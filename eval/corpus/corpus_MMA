mixed martial arts mma is a full contact fighting sport based on striking and grappling incorporating techniques from various combat sports from around the world in the early th century various inter stylistic contests took place throughout japan and the countries of east asia at the same time in bra il there was a phenomenon called vale tudo which became known for unrestricted fights between various styles such as judo bra ilian jiu jitsu catch wrestling luta livre muay thai and capoeira an early high profile mixed bout was kimura vs gracie in in mid th century hong kong rooftop street fighting contests between different martial arts styles gave rise to bruce lee s hybrid martial arts style jeet kune do another precursor to modern mma was the ali vs inoki exhibition bout fought between boxer muhammad ali and wrestler antonio inoki in japan where it later inspired the foundation of shooto in pancrase in and the pride fighting championships in in the s the gracie family brought their bra ilian jiu jitsu style first developed in bra il from the s to the united states which culminated in the founding of the ultimate fighting championship ufc promotion company in the company held an event with almost no rules mostly due to the influence of art davie and rorion gracie attempting to replicate mixed contests that existed in bra il and japan they would later implement a different set of rules example eliminating kicking a grounded opponent which differed from other leagues which were more in favour of realistic street like fights the first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of ufc by television critic howard rosenberg in originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed combat competitors from different fighting styles were pitted against one another in contests with relatively few rules later individual fighters incorporated multiple martial arts into their style mma promoters were pressured to adopt additional rules to increase competitors safety to comply with sport regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of the sport following these changes the sport has seen increased popularity with a pay per view business that rivals boxing and professional wrestling history antiquity in ancient china combat sport appeared in the form of leitai a no holds barred mixed combat sport that combined chinese martial arts boxing and wrestling in ancient greece there was a sport called pankration which featured grappling and striking skills similar to those found in modern mma pankration was formed by combining the already established wrestling and boxing traditions and in olympic terms first featured in the rd olympiad in bc all strikes and holds were allowed with the exception of biting and gouging which were banned the fighters called pankratiasts fought until someone could not continue or signaled submission by raising their index finger there were no rounds according to the historian e norman gardiner no branch of athletics was more popular than the pankration there is also evidence of similar mixed combat sports in ancient egypt india and japan modern era precursors the mid th century saw the prominence of the new sport savate in the combat sports circle french savate fighters wanted to test their techniques against the traditional combat styles of its time in a contest was held in france between french savateurs and english bare knuckle boxers in which french fighter rambaud alias la resistance fought english fighter dickinson and won using his kicks however the english team still won the four other match ups during the contest contests occurred in the late th to mid th century between french savateurs and other combat styles examples include a fight between french savateur george dubois and a judo practitioner re nierand which resulted in the latter winning by submission as well as the highly publici ed fight between french savateur and professional boxer jacques cayron and a young japanese karateka named mochi uki hiroo which ended when cayron knocked hiroo out with a hook catch wrestling appeared in the late th century combining several global styles of wrestling including indian pehlwani and english wrestling in turn catch wrestling went on to greatly influence modern mma no holds barred fighting reportedly took place in the late s when wrestlers representing the style of catch wrestling and many others met in tournaments and music hall challenge matches throughout europe in the us the first major encounter between a boxer and a wrestler in modern times took place in when john l sullivan then heavyweight world boxing champion entered the ring with his trainer wrestling champion william muldoon and was slammed to the mat in two minutes the next publici ed encounter occurred in the late s when future heavyweight boxing champion bob fit simmons took on european wrestling champion ernest roeber in september frank paddy slavin who had been a contender for sullivan s boxing title knocked out future world wrestling champion frank gotch in dawson city canada the judo practitioner ren nierand who gained fame after defeating george dubois would fight again in another similar contest which he lost to ukrainian catch wrestler ivan poddubny another early example of mixed martial arts was bartitsu which edward william barton wright founded in london in combining catch wrestling judo boxing savate jujutsu and canne de combat french stick fighting bartitsu was the first martial art known to have combined asian and european fighting styles and which saw mma style contests throughout england pitting european catch wrestlers and japanese judoka champions against representatives of various european wrestling styles among the precursors of modern mma are mixed style contests throughout europe japan and the pacific rim during the early s in japan these contests were known as merikan from the japanese slang for american fighting merikan contests were fought under a variety of rules including points decision best of three throws or knockdowns and victory via knockout or submission the fight between capoeirista cir aco francisco da silva and jujitsu fighter sada miyako in bra il stands as one of the earliest recorded interdisciplinary martial arts clashes in the country sambo a martial art and combat sport developed in russia in the early s merged various forms of combat styles such as wrestling judo and striking into one unique martial art the popularity of professional wrestling which was contested under various catch wrestling rules at the time waned after world war i when the sport split into two genres shoot in which the fighters actually competed and show which evolved into modern professional wrestling in heavyweight boxing contender kingfish levinsky and professional wrestler ray steele competed in a mixed match which catch wrestler steele won in seconds years later ray steele s prot g lou thes fought boxer jersey joe walcott twice in mixed style bouts the first match was a real contest which thes won while the second match was a work which thes also won in the s in the palama settlement in hawaii five martial arts masters under the leadership of adriano emperado curious to determine which martial art was best began testing each other in their respective arts of kenpo jujitsu chinese and american boxing and tang soo do from this they developed kajukenbo the first american mixed martial arts in a high profile grappling match was masahiko kimura vs h lio gracie which was wrestled between judoka masahiko kimura and bra ilian jiu jitsu founder h lio gracie in bra il kimura defeated gracie using a gyaku ude garami armlock which later became known as the kimura in bra ilian jiu jitsu in a catch wrestler and judoka judo gene lebell fought professional boxer milo savage in a no holds barred match lebell won by harai goshi to rear naked choke leaving savage unconscious this was the first televised bout of mixed style fighting in north america the hometown crowd was so enraged that they began to boo and throw chairs at lebell on february three karatekas from oyama dojo kyokushin later went to the lumpinee boxing stadium in thailand and fought against three muay thai fighters the three kyokushin karate fighters were tadashi nakamura kenji kurosaki and akifujihira also known as noboru osawa while the muay thai team of three authentic thai fighter japan won tadashi nakamura and akio fujihira both knocked out their opponents with punches while kenji kurosaki who fought the thai was knocked out by elbows the japanese fighter who lost kenji kurosaki was a kyokushin instructor rather than a contender and that he had stood in as a substitute for the absent chosen fighter in june of the same year karateka and future kickboxer tadashi sawamura faced top thai fighter samarn sor adisorn sawamura was knocked down sixteen times on his way to defeat sawamura went on to incorporate what he learned in that fight in kickboxing tournaments during the late s to early s the concept of hybrid martial arts was populari ed in the west by bruce lee via his system of jeet kune do lee believed that the best fighter is not a boxer karate or judo man the best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style to be formless to adopt an individual s own style and not following the system of styles in ufc president dana white would call lee the father of mixed martial arts stating if you look at the way bruce lee trained the way he fought and many of the things he wrote he said the perfect style was no style you take a little something from everything you take the good things from every different discipline use what works and you throw the rest away a contemporary of bruce lee wing chun practitioner wong shun leung gained prominence fighting in illegal beimo fights against other chinese martial artists of various styles wong also fought and won against western fighters of other combat styles such as his match against russian boxer giko his televised fight against a fencer and his fight against taiwanese kung fu master wu ming jeet wong combined boxing and kickboxing into his kung fu as bruce lee did muhammad ali vs antonio inoki took place in japan in the classic match up between professional boxer and professional wrestler turned sour as each fighter refused to engage in the other s style and after a round stalemate it was declared a draw muhammad ali sustained a substantial amount of damage to his legs as antonio inoki slide kicked him continuously for the duration of the bout causing him to be hospitali ed for the next three days the fight played an important role in the history of mixed martial arts the basis of modern mixed martial arts in japan can be found across several shoot style professional wrestling promotions such as uwf international and pro wrestling fujiwara gumi both founded in that attempted to create a combat based style which blended wrestling kickboxing and submission grappling another promotion formed around the same time by akira maeda called fighting network rings initially started as a shoot style professional wrestling promotion but it also promoted early mixed martial arts contests from onwards it began identifying itself as a mixed martial arts promotion and moved away from the original shoot style professional wrestlers masakatsu funaki and minoru su uki founded pancrase in which promoted legitimate contests initially under professional wrestling rules these promotions inspired pride fighting championships which started in pride was acquired by its rival ultimate fighting championship in a fight between golden gloves boxing champion joey hadley and arkansas karate champion david valovich happened on june at memphis blues baseball park the bout had mixed rules the karateka was allowed to use his fists feet and knees while the boxer could only use his fists hadley won the fight via knockout on the first round in rick roufus challenged changpuek kiatsongrit to a non title muay thai vs kickboxing super fight roufus was at the time an undefeated kickboxer and held both the kick super middleweight world title and the pkc middleweight u s title kiatsongrit was finding it increasingly difficult to get fights in thailand as his weight kg was not typical for thailand where competitive bouts tended to be at the lower weights roufus knocked changpuek down twice with punches in the first round breaking changpuek s jaw but lost by technical knockout in the fourth round due to the culmination of low kicks to the legs that he was unprepared for this match was the first popular fight which showcased the power of such low kicks to a predominantly western audience growth of mma the growth of mixed martial arts mma globally has been remarkable over the past few decades mma has evolved from being a niche combat sport to one of the most popular and commercially successful sports worldwide timeline of major events modern sport the movement that led to the creation of present day mixed martial arts scenes emerged from a confluence of several earlier martial arts scenes the vale tudo events in bra il rooftop fights in hong kong s street fighting culture and professional wrestlers especially in japan vale tudo began in the s and became renowned through its association with the gracie challenge which was issued by carlos gracie and h lio gracie and upheld later by descendants of the gracie family the gracie challenges were held in the garages and gyms of the gracie family members when the popularity grew these types of mixed bouts were a staple attraction at the carnivals in bra il in the mid th century mixed martial arts contests emerged in hong kong s street fighting culture in the form of rooftop fights during the early th century there was an influx of migrants from mainland china including chinese martial arts teachers who opened up martial arts schools in hong kong in the mid th century soaring crime in hong kong combined with limited hong kong police manpower led to many young hongkongers learning martial arts for self defence around the s there were about martial arts schools in hong kong teaching their own distinctive styles of martial arts in hong kong s street fighting culture there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the s and s where gangs from rival martial arts schools challenged each other to bare knuckle fights on hong kong s rooftops in order to avoid crackdowns by colonial british hong kong authorities the most famous fighter to emerge from hong kong s rooftop fight scene was bruce lee who combined different techniques from different martial arts schools into his own hybrid martial arts system called jeet kune do lee went on to populari e the concept of mixed martial arts internationally early mixed match martial arts professional wrestling bouts in japan known as ishu kakut gi sen literally heterogeneous combat sports bouts became popular with antonio inoki only in the s inoki was a disciple of rikid an but also of karl gotch who trained numerous japanese wrestlers in catch wrestling regulated mixed martial arts competitions were first introduced in the united states by cv productions inc its first competition called tough

pennsylvania state senate passed a bill known as the tough guy law that specifically called for prohibiting tough guy contests or battle of the brawlers contests and ended the sport japan had its own form of mixed martial arts discipline shooto which evolved from shoot wrestling in as well as the shoot wrestling derivative pancrase which was founded as a promotion in pancrase was held in japan in september two months before ufc was held in the united states in november in the sport was reintroduced to the united states by the ultimate fighting championship ufc ufc promoters initially pitched the event as a real life fighting video game tournament similar to street fighter and mortal kombat the sport gained international exposure and widespread publicity when jiu jitsu fighter royce gracie won the first ultimate fighting championship tournament submitting three challengers in a total of just five minutes sparking a revolution in martial arts the first vale tudo japan tournaments were held in and and were both won by rickson gracie around the same time international vale tudo competition started to develop through world vale tudo championship wvc vtj ivc uvf etc interest in mixed martial arts as a sport resulted in the creation of the pride fighting championships pride in the sport reached a new peak of popularity in north america in december a rematch between then ufc light heavyweight champion chuck liddell and former champion tito orti rivaled the ppv sales of some of the biggest boxing events of all time and helped the ufc s ppv gross surpass that of any promotion in ppv history in uffa llc the owners of the ufc mma promotion bought japanese rival mma brand pride fc merging the contracted fighters under one promotion comparisons were drawn to the consolidation that occurred in other sports such as the afl nfl merger in american football origin of the term mma the first documented use of the name mixed martial arts was in a review of ufc by television critic howard rosenberg in the term gained popularity when the website newfullcontact com one of the biggest websites covering the sport at the time hosted and reprinted the article the first use of the term by a promotion was in september by rick blume president and ceo of battlecade extreme fighting just after ufc ufc official jeff blatnick was responsible for the ultimate fighting championship officially adopting the name mixed martial arts it was previously marketed as ultimate fighting and no holds barred nhb until blatnick and john mccarthy proposed the name mma at the ufc rules meeting in response to increased public criticism the question as to who actually coined the name is still in debate regulation the first state regulated mma event was held in biloxi mississippi on august with the sanctioning of ifc s mayhem in mississippi show by the mississippi athletic commission under william lyons the rules used were an adaptation of the kickboxing rules already accepted by most state athletic commissions these modified kickboxing rules allowed for take downs and ground fighting and did away with rounds although they did allow for fighters to be stood up by the referee and restarted if there was no action on the ground these rules were the first in modern mma to define fouls fighting surfaces and the use of the cage in march the iowa athletic commission officially sanctioned battlecade extreme fighting under a modified form of its existing rules for shootfighting these rules created the three five minute round one minute break format and mandated shootfighting gloves as well as weight classes for the first time illegal blows were listed as groin strikes head butting biting eye gouging hair pulling striking an opponent with an elbow while the opponent is on the mat kidney strikes and striking the back of the head with closed fist holding onto the ring or cage for any reason was defined as a foul while there are minor differences between these and the final unified rules notably regarding elbow strikes the iowa rules allowed mixed martial arts promoters to conduct essentially modern events legally anywhere in the state on march extreme fighting was held under these rules making it the first show conducted under a version of the modern rules in april the california state athletic commission voted unanimously in favor of regulations that later became the foundation for the unified rules of mixed martial arts however when the legislation was sent to the california capital in sacramento for review it was determined that the sport fell outside the jurisdiction of the csac rendering the vote meaningless on september the new jersey state athletic control board njsacb began allowing mixed martial arts promoters to conduct events in new jersey the first event was an ifc event titled battleground held in atlantic city the intent was to allow the njsacb to observe actual events and gather information to establish a comprehensive set of rules to regulate the sport effectively on april the njsacb held a meeting to discuss the regulation of mixed martial arts events this meeting attempted to unify the myriad rules and regulations which had been utili ed by the different mixed martial arts organi ations at this meeting the proposed uniform rules were agreed upon by the njsacb several other regulatory bodies numerous promoters of mixed martial arts events and other interested parties in attendance at the conclusion of the meeting all parties in attendance were able to agree upon a uniform set of rules to govern the sport of mixed martial arts the rules adopted by the njsacb have become the de facto standard set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across north america on july a motion was made at the annual meeting of the association of boxing commissions to adopt these rules as the unified rules of mixed martial arts the motion passed unanimously in november the united states army began to sanction mixed martial arts with the first annual army combatives championships held by the us army combatives school canada formally decriminali ed mixed martial arts with a vote on bill s on june the bill allows for provinces to have the power to create athletic commissions to regulate and sanction professional mixed martial arts bouts mma organi ations promotions since the ufc came to prominence in mainstream

organi ed training camps information sharing and modern kinesiology the understanding of the effectiveness of various strategies has been greatly improved ufc commentator joe rogan claimed that martial arts evolved more in the ten years following the first ufc event than in the preceding years combined the high profile of modern mma promotions such as ufc and pride has fostered an accelerated development of the sport the early s saw a wide variety of traditional styles competing in the sport however early competition saw varying levels of success among disparate styles in the early s practitioners of grappling based styles such as bra ilian jiu jitsu dominated competition in the united states practitioners of striking based arts such as boxing kickboxing and karate who were unfamiliar with submission grappling proved to be unprepared to deal with its submission techniques as competitions became more and more common those with a base in striking arts became more competitive as they cross trained in styles based around takedowns and submission holds likewise those from the varying grappling styles added striking techniques to their arsenal this increase of cross training resulted in fighters becoming increasingly multidimensional and well rounded in their skill sets the new hybridi ation of fighting styles can be seen in the technique of ground and pound developed by wrestling based ufc pioneers such as dan severn don frye and mark coleman these wrestlers reali ed the need for the incorporation of strikes on the ground as well as on the feet and incorporated ground striking into their grappling based styles mark coleman stated at ufc that his strategy was to ground him and pound him which may be the first televised use of the term since the late s both strikers and grapplers have been successful at mma although it is rare to see any fighter who is not schooled in both striking and grappling arts reach the highest levels of competition

fighters worldwide in every possible division and p p for female fighters also used by yahoo sports rules the rules for modern mixed martial arts competitions have changed significantly since the early days of vale tudo japanese shoot wrestling and ufc and even more from the historic style of pankration as the knowledge of fighting techniques spread among fighters and spectators it became clear that the original minimalist rule systems needed to be amended the main motivations for these rule changes were protection of the health of the fighters the desire to shed the perception of barbarism and lawlessness and to be recogni ed as a legitimate sport the new rules included the introduction of weight classes as knowledge about submissions spread differences in weight had become a significant factor there are nine different weight classes in the unified rules of mixed martial arts these nine weight classes include flyweight up to lb kg bantamweight up to lb kg featherweight up to lb kg lightweight up to lb kg welterweight up to lb kg middleweight up to lb kg light heavyweight up to lb kg heavyweight up to lb kg and super heavyweight with no upper weight limit small open fingered gloves were introduced to protect fists reduce the occurrence of cuts and stoppages due to cuts and encourage fighters to use their hands for striking to allow more captivating matches gloves were first made mandatory in japan s shooto promotion and were later adopted by the ufc as it developed into a regulated sport most professional fights have the fighters wear o gloves whereas some jurisdictions require amateurs to wear a slightly heavier o glove for more protection for the hands and wrists time limits were established to avoid long fights with little action where competitors conserved their strength matches without time limits also complicated the airing of live events the time limits in most professional fights are three minute rounds and championship fights are normally five minute rounds similar motivations produced the stand up rule where the referee can stand fighters up if it is perceived that both are resting on the ground or not advancing toward a dominant position in the united states state athletic and boxing commissions have played a crucial role in the introduction of additional rules because they oversee mma in a similar fashion to boxing in japan and most of europe there is no regulating authority over competitions so these organi ations have greater freedom in rule development and event structure previously japanese based organi ation pride fighting championships held an opening minute round followed by two five minute rounds stomps soccer kicks and knees to the head of a grounded opponent are legal but elbow strikes to the head are not this rule set is more predominant in the asian based organi ations as opposed to european and american rules more recently singapore based organi ation one championship allows soccer kicks and knees to the head of a grounded opponent as well as elbow strikes to the head but does not allow head stomps in one later banned soccer kicks however they still allow knees to the head of a grounded opponent in the association of boxing commissions and combative sports mixed martial arts committee made changes to the unified rules of mixed martial arts loosening the rules surrounding what a grounded opponent is meaning fighters are now more vulnerable to kicks and knees to the head and they also eliminated the rules prohibiting to elbows victory victory in a match is normally gained either by the judges decision after an allotted amount of time has elapsed a stoppage by the referee for example if a competitor cannot defend themselves intelligently or the fight doctor due to an injury a submission by a competitor s cornerman throwing in the towel or by knockout knockout ko as soon as a fighter is unable to continue due to legal strikes his opponent is declared the winner as mma rules allow submissions and ground and pound the fight is stopped to prevent further injury to the fighter technical knockout tko referee stoppage the referee may stop a match in progress if a fighter becomes dominant to the point where the opponent cannot intelligently defend themselves and is taking excessive damage as a result a fighter appears to be losing consciousness as he she is being struck a fighter appears to have a significant injury such as a cut or a broken bone doctor stoppage cut the referee will call for a time out if a fighter s ability to continue is in question as a result of apparent injuries such as a large cut the ring doctor will inspect the fighter and stop the match if the fighter is deemed unable to continue safely rendering the opponent the winner however if the match is stopped as a result of an injury from illegal actions by the opponent either a disqualification or no contest will be issued instead corner stoppage a fighter s corner may announce defeat on the fighter s behalf by throwing in the towel during the match in progress or between rounds this is normally done when a fighter is being beaten to the point where it is dangerous and unnecessary to continue in some cases the fighter may be injured retirement a fighter is so da ed or exhausted that he she cannot physically continue fighting usually occurs between rounds submission a fighter may admit defeat during a match by a physical tap on the opponent s body or mat floor tapping verbally technical submission the referee stops the match when the fighter is caught in a submission hold and is in danger of being injured this can occur when a fighter is choked unconscious or when a bone has been broken in a submission hold a broken arm due to a kimura etc decision if the match goes the distance then the outcome of the bout is determined by three judges the judging criteria are organi ation specific technical decision in the unified rules of mma if a fighter is unable to continue due to an accidental illegal technique late in the fight a technical decision is rendered by the judges based on who is ahead on the judges scorecards at that time in a three round fight two rounds must be completed for a technical decision to be awarded and in a five round fight three rounds must be completed other conditions forfeit a fighter or their representative may forfeit a match prior to the beginning of the match thereby losing the match disqualification a warning will be given when a fighter commits a foul or illegal action or does not follow the referee s instruction three warnings will result in a disqualification moreover if a fighter is unable to continue due to a deliberate illegal technique from his opponent the opponent will be disqualified no contest in the event that both fighters commit a violation of the rules or a fighter is unable to continue due to an injury from an accidental illegal technique the match will be declared a no contest except in the case of a technical decision in the unified rules a result can also be overturned to a no contest if the fighter that was originally victorious fails a post fight drug test for banned substances clothing mixed martial arts promotions typically require that male fighters wear shorts in addition to being barechested thus precluding the use of gi or fighting kimono to inhibit or assist submission holds male fighters are required by most athletic commissions to wear groin protectors underneath their trunks female fighters wear short shorts and sports bras or other similarly snug fitting tops both male and female fighters are required to wear a mouthguard the need for flexibility in the legs combined with durability prompted the creation of various fighting shorts brands which then spawned a range of mixed martial arts clothing and casual wear available to the public fighting area according to the unified rules of mixed martial arts an mma competition or exhibition may be held in a ring or a fenced area the fenced area can be round or have at least six sides cages vary some replace the metal fencing with a net others have a different shape from an octagon as the term the octagon is trademarked by the ufc although the sided shape itself is not trademarked the fenced area is called a cage generically or a hexagon an octagon or an octagon cage depending on the shape common disciplines most traditional martial arts have a specific focus and these arts may be trained to improve in that area popular disciplines of each type include stand up boxing kickboxing muay thai karate taekwondo capoeira combat sambo savate and sanda are trained to improve stand up striking clinch judo freestyle wrestling folkstyle wrestling greco roman wrestling catch wrestling sanda and sambo are trained to improve clinching takedowns and throws while muay thai is trained to improve the striking aspect of the clinch ground bra ilian jiu jitsu judo sambo folkstyle wrestling freestyle wrestling catch wrestling greco roman wrestling and luta livre are trained to improve ground control and position as well as to achieve submission holds and defend against them most styles have been adapted from their traditional forms such as boxing stances which lack effective counters to leg kicks the muay thai stance which is poor for defending against takedowns due to its static nature and a light front leg and judo or bra ilian jiu jitsu techniques which must be adapted for no gi competition and susceptibility to strikes it is common for a fighter to train with multiple coaches of different styles or an organi ed fight team to improve various aspects of their game at once cardiovascular conditioning speed drills strength training and flexibility are also important aspects of a fighter s training some schools advertise their styles as simply mixed martial arts which has become a style in itself but the training will still often be split into different sections while mixed martial arts was initially practiced almost exclusively by competitive fighters this is no longer the case as the sport has become more mainstream and more widely taught it has become accessible to wider range of practitioners of all ages proponents of this sort of training argue that it is safe for anyone of any age with varying levels of competitiveness and fitness bra ilian jiu jitsu bra ilian jiu jitsu bjj is a form of submission grappling it came to international prominence in the martial arts community in the early s when bjj expert royce gracie won the first second and fourth ultimate fighting championships which at the time were single elimination martial arts tournaments royce often fought successfully against larger opponents who practiced other styles including boxing wrestling shoot fighting karate and taekwondo it has since become a staple art and key component for many mma fighters bjj is largely credited for bringing widespread attention to the importance of ground fighting bjj is primarily a ground based fighting style that applies close range grappling techniques and uses joint locks and chokeholds to submit the adversary but standup techniques can also be used such as throws holds and strikes some notable fighters who are known for using bjj skills include alexandre pantoja amanda nunes anderson silva ant nio rodrigo nogueira

ilia topuria jim miller nate dia gabriel ben te tom aspinall and tony ferguson wrestling wrestling including freestyle greco roman and american folkstyle gained tremendous respect due to its effectiveness in mixed martial arts competitions it is widely studied by mixed martial artists as wrestling allows competitors to control where the match will go superior wrestlers can dominate the clinch and take their opponents into the ground with its excellent takedowns particularly against the legs where they will transition into groundfighting and can either get a superior top position and start striking their opponent a tactic known as ground and pound or start grappling for submissions while wrestlers with stronger striking base can use defensive wrestling to defend takedowns maintain the fight in the feet where they use their superior striking a tactic known as sprawl and brawl or use wrestling to escape submission attempts it is also credited for conferring an emphasis on conditioning for explosive movement and stamina both of which are critical in competitive mixed martial arts there are multiple wrestling styles around the world which mma fighters have as their base american fighters are usually trained in folkstyle wrestling the style competed in high school and college competitions many american champions were former ncaa division i wrestling champions such as kevin randleman and mark kerr while fighters from around the world train primarily in international olympic styles such as greco roman and freestyle wrestling some former wrestlers who competed in the olympics have joined mma competition such as daniel cormier dan henderson ben askren silver medalists matt lindland and yoel romero and gold medalist henry cejudo some fighters have also come from local folk wrestling backgrounds ufc flyweight champion deiveson figueiredo is trained at luta marajoara a folk wrestling style from maraj island notable wrestlers who were mma competitors include khabib nurmagomedov jon jones chael sonnen georges st pierre cain velasque randy couture brock lesnar mark coleman frankie edgar colby covington kamaru usman justin gaethje chris weidman daniel

wrestling contested at the olympic games the other being freestyle greco roman wrestling only allows for holds above the waist and has a strong emphasis on clinch fighting due to the difficulty to

wrestling while the professional side became modern professional wrestling catch survived in japanese puroresu style pro wrestling where wrestlers such as antonio inoki and karl gotch promoted strong style pro wrestling that while worked had realistic and full contact moves resulting in the creation of the universal wrestling federation and shoot wrestling which in their own turn would inspire the creation of legit proto mma shootfighting organi ations such as shooto and pancrase many pro wrestlers that trained in shoot style would later compete in mma which led to resurgence of catch with the advent of mixed martial arts in the s the term no holds barred was used originally to describe the wrestling method prevalent in catch wrestling tournaments during the late th century wherein no wrestling holds were banned from the competition regardless of how dangerous they might be the term was applied to mixed martial arts matches especially at the advent of the ultimate fighting

livre is divided in the categories of esportiva which is a form of submission grappling differentiating from no gi bjj with its focus on quick and energetic submissions and vale tudo which includes strikes both standing up and on the ground in addition to grappling and submissions luta livre was important to the development of mixed martial arts as rivalry between jiu jitsu and luta livre fueled the vale tudo scene however the success of bra ilian jiu jitsu over luta livre practitioners especially after the desafio jiu jitsu vs luta livre event in which was broadcast live by rede globo resulted in the style waning in popularity although it seems to be making a resurgence especially as an alternative to both bra ilian jiu jitsu and catch wrestling some notable luta livre

strategies from judo can not be translated into mma fighters who hold a black belt in judo include fedor emelianenko marco ruas khabib nurmagomedov islam makhachev ian garry dong hyun kim cub swanson

has punching kicking some use of elbows and knee strikes similar to kickboxing or muay thai but it has the distinction of allowing a range of takedowns throws and sweeps similar to judo and wrestling

by fighters from china but it has found a following amongst many fighters around the world chief amongst these fighters is cung le who is most notable for his tko and ko victories over former ufc champions frank shamrock and rich franklin and ufc strawweight champion hang weili the first chinese champion in the ufc other wushu sanshou based fighters who have entered mma include michael page

anderson silva who is a th dan black belt in his instructional book anderson silva admitted the influence of taekwondo in the formation of his unique style in each of my fights i tried to utili e techniques from all the various styles i had studied i threw taekwondo kicks i threw muay thai knees and elbows and i used my knowledge of bra ilian jiu jitsu on the ground anthony pettis has also stated that he is definitely a traditional martial artist first and a mixed martial artist second as well as his style of attacking is different because of his taekwondo background other notable fighters who have a base in taekwondo or are known for using their taekwondo skills while fighting include edson barbo a valentina shevchenko benson henderson yair rodrigue anthony pettis mirko cro cop cory sandhagen israel adesanya and conor mcgregor capoeira capoeira is an afro bra ilian art form that incorporates elements of martial arts games music and dance capoeira is often practiced as a form of dancing and game but its origins lie as a concealed style of self defense and combat and can be used as such it uses a style of fighting with quick and complex maneuvers which use power speed and leverage across a wide variety of kicks spins and techniques pure capoeira is difficult to use in mma due its complexity but many fighters incorporated individual techniques into their reportoire additionally capoeira has an importance to mma history as many capoeiristas participated in vale tudo challenges in bra il against practitioners of other martial arts in particular with a rivalry with bra ilian jiu jitsu in at the desafio internacional de vale tudo event capoeirista mestre hulk defeated two time bjj world champion amaury bitetti using capoeira techniques in an underdog victory some fighters which have trained capoeira and incorporated techniques include anderson silva conor mcgregor deiveson figueiredo thiago santos marco ruas and michel pereira savate although not as common as other disciplines some fighters have used savate effectively in mma savate restricts the use of shins and knees allowing only foot kicks it focuses on kicking more than punching and its kicks are characteristically very fast mobile and flexible it also possesses a complex and evasive footwork however because savatuers train wearing shoes adjustments have to be made to how they throw kicks in mma notable savate fighters include karl amoussou gerard gordeau cheick kongo and former bellator light heavyweight champion christian m pumbu basic strategies the techniques utili ed in mixed martial arts competition generally fall into two categories striking techniques such as kicks knees punches and elbows and grappling techniques such as clinch holds pinning holds submission holds sweeps takedowns and throws today mixed martial artists must cross train in a variety of styles to counter their opponent s strengths and remain effective in all the phases of combat sprawl and brawl sprawl and brawl is a stand up fighting tactic that consists of effective stand up striking while avoiding ground fighting typically by using sprawls to defend against takedowns or throws a sprawl and brawler is usually a boxer kickboxer or karateka who has trained in various styles of wrestling judo and or sambo to avoid takedowns to keep the fight standing this is a form which is heavily practiced in the amateur leagues these fighters will often study submission grappling to avoid being forced into submission should they find themselves on the ground this style can be deceptively different from traditional kickboxing styles since sprawl and brawlers must adapt their techniques to incorporate takedown and ground fighting defense a few notable examples are igor vovchanchyn mirko filipovi chuck liddell mark hunt and more recently alex pereira francis ngannou junior dos santos justin gaethje andrei arlovski and joanna j dr ejc yk ground and pound ground and pound is a strategy consisting of taking an opponent to the ground using a takedown or throw obtaining a top or dominant grappling position and then striking the opponent repeatedly primarily with fists hammerfists and elbows ground and pound is also used as a precursor to attempting submission holds the style is used by fighters well versed in submission defense and skilled at takedowns they take the fight to the ground maintain a grappling position and strike until their opponent submits or is knocked out although not a traditional style of striking the effectiveness and reliability of ground and pound has made it a popular tactic it was first demonstrated as an effective technique by mark coleman then populari ed by fighters such as chael sonnen glover teixeira don frye frank trigg jon jones cheick kongo mark kerr frank shamrock tito orti matt hughes daniel cormier chris weidman and khabib nurmagomedov while most fighters use ground and pound statically by way of holding their opponents down and hitting them with short strikes from the top position a few fighters manage to utili e it dynamically by striking their opponents while changing positions thus not allowing their opponents to settle once they take them down cain velasque is one of the most devastating ground strikers in mma and is known for continuing to strike his opponents on the ground while transitioning between positions fedor emelianenko considered among the greatest masters of ground and pound in mma history was the first to demonstrate this dynamic style of striking in transition he was striking his opponents on the ground while passing guard or while his opponents were attempting to recover guard in the year mma play by play commentator stephen quadros coined the popular phrase lay and pray this refers to a situation where a wrestler or grappler keeps another fighter pinned or controlled on the mat throwing light strikes to avoid a stand up yet exhibit little urgency to finish the grounded opponent with a knockout or a submission for the majority or entirety of the fight looking for a decision win through high control time the implication of lay and pray is that after the wrestler grappler takes the striker down and lays on them to neutrali e the opponent s striking weapons they pray that the referee does not return them to the standing position this style is considered by many fans as the most boring style of fighting and is highly critici ed for intentionally creating non action yet it is effective some argue that lay and pray is justified and that it is the responsibility of the downed fighter to be able to protect themselves from this legitimate technique former ufc welterweight champion georges st pierre has been critici ed by fans for playing it safe and applying the lay and pray tactic in his fights as has former bellator mma welterweight champion ben askren who justified the tactic explaining that championship fights are much harder as they are five rounds long compared with the usual three submission seeking submission seeking is a reference to the strategy of taking an opponent to the ground using a takedown or throw and then applying a submission hold forcing the opponent to submit while grapplers will often work to attain dominant position some may be more comfortable fighting from other positions ex fighters pulling guard it enable fighters to force opponents into submission through joint locks or chokes bra ilian jiu jitsu bjj plays a significant role in mma submission grappling with techniques such as armbars triangles rear naked chokes guillotines and kimuras being commonly utili ed if a grappler finds themselves unable to force a takedown they may resort to pulling guard whereby they voluntarily pull their opponent into a dominant position on the ground this was one of the first fighting styles that had shown success populari ed by bjj exponent royce gracie during early ufc events submissions are an essential part of many disciplines most notably bra ilian jiu jitsu catch wrestling judo sambo luta livre and shoot wrestling submission based styles were populari ed in the early ufc events by royce gracie and ken shamrock and were the dominant tactic in the early ufcs modern proponents of the submission seeking style such as demian maia ronaldo sou a charles oliveira ryan hall marcin held and paul craig tend to come from a bra ilian jiu jitsu background clinch fighting clinch fighting is a tactic consisting of using a clinch hold to prevent the opponent from moving away into more distant striking range while also attempting takedowns or throws and striking the opponent using knees stomps elbows and punches the clinch is often utili ed by wrestlers and judokas that have added components of the striking game typically boxing and muay thai fighters ken shamrock was known for his impressive clinch work when he submitted dan severn with a standing guillotine choke at ufc wrestlers and judoka may use clinch fighting as a way to neutrali e the superior striking skills of a stand up fighter to prevent takedowns or throws by a superior ground fighter ronda rousey with her judo background is considered a master at initiating throws from the clinch to set up armbars the clinch or plum of a muay thai fighter is often used to improve the accuracy of knees and elbows by physically controlling the position of the opponent anderson silva is well known for his devastating muay thai clinch he defeated ufc middle weight champion rich franklin using the muay thai clinch and kneeing franklin repeatedly to the body and face breaking franklin s nose in their rematch silva repeated this and won again other fighters may use the clinch to push their opponent against the cage or ropes where they can effectively control their opponent s movement and restrict mobility while striking them with punches to the body or stomps also known as dirty boxing or wall and maul randy couture used his greco roman wrestling background to populari e this style en route to six title reigns in the ufc score oriented fighting score oriented fighting is a style that is based around trying to win through outscoring their opponent and winning a decision usually fighters who adopt this strategy use takedowns only for scoring allowing the adversary to stand up and continue the fight they also want to land clear strikes and control the octagon in order to win the fight by decision all score oriented fighters have to have strong defensive techniques and avoid takedowns in general fighters who cannot win fights through lightning offense or are more suited to win fights in the later rounds or via decision are commonly known as grinders grinders aim to shut down their opponent s game plan and chip away at them via light strikes clinching smothering and ground and pound for most of the rounds prominent examples of grinders are sean strickland who has a very defensive and stand up striking focused style and merab dvalishvili who has a very aggressive wrestling focused style women s mixed martial arts while mixed martial arts is primarily a male dominated sport it does have female athletes female competition in japan includes promotions such as the all female valkyrie and jewels formerly known as smackgirl however historically there has been only a select few major professional mixed martial arts organi ations in the united states that invite women to compete among those are the ufc strikeforce bellator fighting championships the all female invicta fighting championships and the now defunct elitexc

inception of the unified rules of mixed martial arts there remains a paucity of data on injuries that occur in mma and resulting concerns with regard to mma s safety remain a systematic review concluded that the injury incidence rate in mma appears to be greater than in most if not all other popular and commonly practiced combat sports injury rates in a meta analysis of the available injury data in mma the injury incidence rate was estimated to be injuries per athlete exposures one athlete exposure is defined as one athlete participating in a single fight the estimated injury incidence rate in mma is greater than in other full contact combat sports such as judo injuries per athlete exposures taekwondo injuries per athlete exposures amateur boxing injuries per athlete exposures and professional boxing injuries per athlete exposures injury pattern in general the injury pattern in mma is very similar to that in professional boxing but unlike that found in other combat sports such as judo and taekwondo the most commonly injured body region is the head to of reported injuries followed by the wrist hand to of reported injuries while the most frequent types of injury were laceration to of reported injuries fracture to of reported injuries and concussion to of reported injuries the frequency of impact to the ear and low utili ation of ear protection leads to a high frequency of perichondral hematoma that can lead to cauliflower ear brain injury and cte the repeated head strikes received by mma competitors causes frequent concussions and permanent brain damage also the repeated head trauma in contact sports especially combat sports are directly related to a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte this disease begins to develop during the life of the athlete and continues to develop even after sports activity has ceased because the disease is detected post mortem and mma as a sport is relatively young there are still few cases of cte recogni ed in mma although there are more and more suspected and confirmed cases of cte in preliminary results reported in april as part of an ongoing study of a professional boxers and mma fighters being conducted by charles bernick and his colleagues at cleveland clinic s lou ruvo center for brain health fighters with more than six years of ring experience were observed to have reductions in si e in their hippocampus and thalamus while fighters with more than twelve years of ring experience were observed to have both reductions in si e and symptoms such as memory loss the hippocampus and thalamus deal with memory and alertness bernick speculates that the cumulative damage over time from lesser blows may eventually prove an even more important topic of study than that of infrequent concussions in january veteran ufc fighter spencer fisher confirmed to mma fighting that he suffered from all the symptoms of cte i m just beat up and it s just gotten worse like all my injuries are catching up with me now aside from the brain thing which is the biggest one because it adds it adds the depression and putting things thoughts together and staying on track later dana white ruled on this he s not the first and he s definitely not going to be the last this is a contact sport and anybody who s ever done this younger myself included is dealing with brain issues it s part of the gig in late rose gracie daughter of ufc founder rorion gracie in an interview about cte on the troca o franca podcast called the lack of cte awareness in mma criminal negligence although brain damage is common for mma fighters some like demetrious johnson managed to avoid it johnson participated in a long term brain study from to by the cleveland clinic where he underwent regular evaluations despite his year mma career doctors concluded that his brain had not deteriorated at all in fact they found improvements in his cognitive abilities including speech articulation and iq however it is important to note that throughout his career he only suffered one knockout and much less head trauma than other fighters fatalities there have been seven known deaths in mma to date there were no documented cases of deaths after a sanctioned mma event prior to since there have been six fatalities in mixed martial arts matches the first was the death of sam vasque on november vasque collapsed shortly after being knocked out by vince libardi in the third round of an october fight at the toyota center in houston texas vasque had two separate surgeries to remove blood clots from his brain and shortly after the second operation suffered a stroke and did not regain consciousness the second death stemming from a sanctioned mixed martial arts contest occurred in south carolina on june when year old michael kirkham was knocked out and never regained consciousness he was pronounced dead two days after the fight the third death on august involved year old tyrone mims who was making his amateur mma debut at conflict mma fight night at the point vi in south carolina making his the second mma related death in the state after being tko d in the second round of the fight he became unresponsive and was taken to medical university hospital where he was pronounced dead one hour later no evidence of brain trauma or concussion was found and the initial autopsy has proved inconclusive coroner rae wooten explained that his death may probably have been from an irregular heartbeat caused by over exertion however whether or not his death was a direct result of his fight remains a mystery on february year old booto guylain was transported to johannesburg general hospital to be treated for swelling and bleeding on the brain after suffering a ko loss via elbow in the last round of his fight in south african promotion extreme fighting championship africa he was unable to make a recovery and after one week in the hospital he was pronounced dead on april year old jo o carvalho died following a total extreme fighting event at the national stadium in dublin ireland the portuguese fighter was beaten by technical knockout in a fight on april against charlie ward and fell ill twenty minutes after the fight he was taken immediately to beaumont hospital where he underwent emergency brain surgery but died two days later on july after a tko loss resulting from unanswered punches in the second round of his fight year old donshay white became unresponsive and collapsed in his locker room and was rushed to the kentuckyone health sts mary eli abeth hospital in kentucky he was soon pronounced dead and was revealed to be caused by hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease legality of professional competitions professional mma competitions enjoy different levels of legality in different countries this is dependent on the laws of the specific state the international mixed martial arts federation attempts to provide an internationally recognised set of standards which will be universally adhered to however they have no basis in national law and are meant as advisement only whereby regulation exists however the likelihood of mma being legally recognised as a legitimate sport is increased this was the case with france who banned it as a sport in due to a lack of regulation then unbanned it in after a french federation began regulating it
