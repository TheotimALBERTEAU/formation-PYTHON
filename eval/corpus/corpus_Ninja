a ninja english japanese i d a shinobi no mono japanese i no b i no mo no or shinobi japanese i no b i was a spy and infiltrator in pre modern japan antecedents may have existed as early as the th century there is little evidence that they were assassins in the unrest of the sengoku period ji amurai families that is elite peasant warriors in iga province and the adjacent k ka district formed ikki revolts or leagues as a means of self defense they became known for their military activities in the nearby regions and sold their services as mercenaries and spies following the tokugawa shogunate in the th century the ninja faded into obscurity by the time of the meiji restoration shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in japan ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility walking on water and control over natural elements much of their perception in popular culture is based on such legends and folklore as opposed to the covert actors of the sengoku period etymology ninja is the on yomi early middle chinese influenced reading of the two kanji in the native kun yomi reading it is pronounced shinobi a shortened form of shinobi no mono the word shinobi appears in the written record as far back as the late th century in poems in the man y sh the underlying connotation of shinobi means to steal away to hide and by extension to forbear hence its association with stealth and invisibility mono means a person historically the word ninja was not in common use and a variety of regional colloquialisms evolved to describe what would later be dubbed ninja along with shinobi these include monomi one who sees noki aru macaque on the roof rappa ruffian kusa grass and iga mono one from iga in historical documents shinobi is almost always used in modern fiction kunoichi is also another word used to describe ninja specifically female ones it was originally argot for woman it supposedly comes from the characters ku no and ichi which make up the three strokes that form the kanji for woman in english the plural of ninja can be either unchanged as ninja reflecting the japanese language s lack of grammatical number or the regular english plural ninjas history despite many popular folktales historical accounts of the ninja are scarce the social origin of the ninja is seen as the reason they agree to operate in secret trading their service for money without honor and glory the first dubbed ninja was a man named otomono sahito though historical evidence of his existence is scarce however some ninjutsu books described specifically what tactics ninja should use to fight and the scenarios in which a ninja might find themselves can be deduced from those tactics for example in the manuscript of volume of kanrin seiy which is the original book of bansensh kai there are points of ninja s fighting techniques such as how to make makibishi from bamboo how to make footwear that makes no sound fighting techniques when surrounded by many enemies precautions when using swords at night how to listen to small sounds kuji kiri that prevents guard dogs from barking and so on predecessors the title ninja has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi legendary nd century prince yamato takeru prince shotoku who lived from ad was believed to have employed a ninja spy named otomono sahito in the kojiki the young yamato takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the kumaso people however these records take place at a very early stage of japanese history and they are unlikely to be connected to the shinobi of later accounts the first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of prince sh toku in the th century such tactics were considered unsavory even in early times when according to the th century sh monki the boy spy hasetsukabe no koharumaru was killed for spying against the insurgent taira no masakado the history of ninjitsu school recorded around th century when daisuke togakure and kain doshi formali ed the teaching of chinese and native japanese guerilla tactics to which somewhat considered as counter culture of the time as a samurai daisuke lost his lands and title after defeated in a regional conflict refused to committed seppuku daisuke travelled to the mountains of southwest honshu in here he met doshi a chinese warrior monk daisuke abandon his way of bushido and worked with doshi formulate the guerilla art of war called ninjutsu daisuke s descendants founded the first ninja ryu org ninja school the togakureryu later the th century war chronicle taiheiki contained many references to shinobi and credited the destruction of a castle by fire to an unnamed but highly skilled shinobi early history it was not until the th century that spies were specially trained for their purpose it was around this time that the word shinobi appeared to define and clearly identify ninja as a secretive group of agents evidence for this can be seen in historical documents which began to refer to stealthy soldiers as shinobi during the sengoku period later manuals regarding espionage are often grounded in chinese military strategy quoting works such as the art of war by sun t u by the sengoku period the shinobi had several roles including spy kanch scout teisatsu surprise attacker kishu and agitator konran the ninja families were organi ed into larger guilds each with their own territories a system of rank existed a j nin upper person was the highest rank representing the group and hiring out mercenaries this is followed by the ch nin middle person assistants to the j nin at the bottom was the genin lower person field agents drawn from the lower class and assigned to carry out actual missions iga and k ga clans the iga and k ga clans were ji amurai families living in the province of iga modern mie prefecture and the adjacent region of k ka later written as k ga named after a village in what is now shiga prefecture from these regions villages devoted to the training of ninja first appeared the remoteness and inaccessibility of the surrounding mountains in iga may have had a role in the ninja s secretive development the chronicle go kagami furoku writes of the two clans origins there was a retainer of the family of kawai aki no kami of iga of pre eminent skill in shinobi and consequently for generations the name of people from iga became established another tradition grew in k ga likewise a supplement to the nochi kagami a record of the ashikaga shogunate confirms the same iga origin inside the camp at magari of the sh gun ashikaga yoshihisa there were shinobi whose names were famous throughout the land when yoshihisa attacked rokkaku takayori the family of kawai aki no kami of iga who served him at magari earned considerable merit as shinobi in front of the great army of the sh gun since then successive generations of iga men have been admired this is the origin of the fame of the men of iga these professional ninja were actively hired by daimy s between and specifically the iga professionals were sought after for their skill at siege warfare or shirotori which included night attacks and ambush by the s the leading families in the regions had established de facto independence from their shugo the k ka ikki persisted until when it was forced to become a vassal of oda nobunaga the iga ikki continued until when nobunaga invaded iga province and wiped out the organi ed clans survivors were forced to flee some to the mountains of kii but others arrived before tokugawa ieyasu where they were well treated some former iga clan members including hattori han would later serve as tokugawa s bodyguards prior to the conquest of k ka in the two confederacies worked in alliance together at an approximate date of the alliance between iga and k ka was formali ed in constitutional document following the battle of okeha ama in tokugawa employed a group of eighty k ga ninja led by tomo sukesada they were tasked to raid an outpost of the imagawa clan the account of this assault is given in the mikawa go fudoki where it was written that k ga ninja infiltrated the castle set fire to its towers and killed the castellan along with two hundred of the garrison activities under tokugawa after the assassination of oda nobunaga iga and k ka ninja according to tradition helped ieyasu undergo the famous shinkun iga goe journey according to one theory by researchers from mie university with helps of k ka clan s ji amurai militias instead of ninja to escape the enemies of nobunaga in sakai and return to mikawa however their journey was very dangerous due to the existence of ochimusha gari groups across the route during this journey tokugawa generals such as ii naomasa sakai tadatsugu and honda tadakatsu fought their way through raids and harassment from ochimusha gari outlaws to secure the way for ieyasu while sometimes advancing by usage of gold and silver bribes given to some of the more amenable ochimusha gari groups as they reached kada an area between kameyama town and iga the attacks from ochimusha gari finally ended as they reached the former territory of the k ka ikki who were friendly to the tokugawa clan the koka clan assisted the tokugawa escort group in eliminating the threats of ochimusha gari outlaws then escorting them until they reached iga province where they were further protected by samurai clans from iga ikki which accompanied the ieyasu group until they safely reached mikawa in one notable incident from a ninja sneak through of eastern army defenders during the siege of hataya and planted the flag of the besieging army high on the front gate in a daimyo named t d takatora was assigned by ieyasu to control of tsu a newly established domain which covered portions of iga and ise province the domain at first worth of to the then grow further in productivity to the total revenue of koku under takatora governance it was reported that t d takatora employs the iga ry ninjas aside from ninjas he also employs local clans of iga province as musokunin which is a class of part time samurai who has been allowed to retain their clan name but does not own any land or han the musokunin also worked as farmer during peace while they are obliged to take arms in the time of war in the iga province warriors saw action during the siege of osaka takatora brought the musokunin auxiliaries from iga province to besiege the osaka castle during the winter phase shimabara rebellion a final but detailed record of ninja employed in open warfare occurred during the shimabara rebellion the k ga ninja were recruited by sh gun tokugawa iemitsu against christian rebels led by amakusa shir who made a final stand at hara castle in hi en province a diary kept by a member of the matsudaira clan the amakusa gunki relates men from k ga in mi province who concealed their appearance would steal up to the castle every night and go inside as they pleased the ukai diary written by a descendant of ukai kanemon has several entries describing the reconnaissance actions taken by the k ga they the k ga were ordered to reconnoitre the plan of construction of hara castle and surveyed the distance from the defensive moat to the ni no maru second bailey the depth of the moat the conditions of roads the height of the wall and the shape of the loopholes suspecting that the castle s supplies might be running low the siege commander matsudaira nobutsuna ordered a raid on the castle s provisions here the k ga captured bags of enemy provisions and infiltrated the castle by night obtaining secret passwords days later nobutsuna ordered an intelligence gathering mission to determine the castle s supplies several k ga ninja some apparently descended from those involved in the assault on an imagawa clan castle volunteered despite being warned that chances of survival were slim a volley of shots was fired into the sky causing the defenders to extinguish the castle lights in preparation under the cloak of darkness ninja disguised as defenders infiltrated the castle capturing a banner of the christian cross the ukai diary writes we dispersed spies who were prepared to die inside hara castle those who went on the reconnaissance in force captured an enemy flag both arakawa shichirobei and mochi uki yo emon met extreme resistance and suffered from their serious wounds for days as the siege went on the extreme shortage of food later reduced the defenders to eating moss and grass this desperation would mount to futile charges by the rebels where they were eventually defeated by the shogunate army the k ga would later take part in conquering the castle more and more general raids were begun the k ga ninja band under the direct control of matsudaira nobutsuna captured the ni no maru and the san no maru outer bailey with the fall of hara castle the shimabara rebellion came to an end and christianity in japan was forced underground these written accounts are the last mention of ninja in war edo period after the shimabara rebellion there were almost no major wars or battles until the bakumatsu era to earn a living ninja had to be employed by the governments of their han domain or change their profession many lords still hired ninja not for battle but as bodyguards or spies their duties included spying on other domains guarding the daimy and fire patrol a few domains like tsu hirosaki and saga continued to employ their own ninja into the bakumatsu era although their precise numbers are unknown a number of shinobi manuals often based on chinese military philosophy were written in the th and th centuries most notably the bansensh kai many former ninja were employed as security guards by the tokugawa shogunate though the role of espionage was transferred to newly created organi ations like the onmitsu and the oniwaban others used their ninjutsu knowledge to become doctors medicine sellers merchants martial artists and fireworks manufacturers some unemployed ninja were reduced to banditry such as f ma kotar and ishikawa goemon ninja stereotypes in theatre many ubiquitous stereotypes about ninja were developed within edo theatre these include their black clothing which was supposed to imitate the outfits worn by kuroko stagehands meant to be ignored by the audience and their use of shuriken which was meant to contrast with the use of swords by onstage samurai in kabuki theatre ninja were dishonorable and often sorcerous counterparts to samurai and possessed almost if not outright magical means of camouflage contemporary between and artifacts dating to the siege of odawara were uncovered which experts say are ninja weapons ninja were spies and saboteurs and likely participated in the siege the hojo clan failed to save the castle from toyotomi hideyoshi forces the uncovered flat throwing stones are likely predecessors of the shuriken the clay caltrops preceded makibishi caltrops archeologist iwata akihiro of saitama prefectural museum of history and folklore said the flat throwing stones were used to stop the movement of the enemy who was going to attack a soldier at any moment and while the enemy free ed the soldier escaped the clay caltrops could stop the movement of the enemy who invaded the castle these weapons were hastily constructed yet effective and used by a battle group which can move into action as ninjas mie university founded the world s first research centre devoted to the ninja in a graduate master course opened in it is located in iga now mie prefecture there are approximately student enrollments per year students must pass an admission test about japanese history and be able to read historical ninja documents scientific researchers and scholars of different disciplines study ancient documents and how it can be used in the modern world on june k ka city in shiga prefecture announced that a written copy of kanrinseiyo which is the original source of a famous book on the art of ninja called bansenshukai from the edo period was discovered in a warehouse of ka uraki shrine the handwritten reproduction was produced in the book describes types of ninjutsu it has information about specific methods such as attaching layers of cotton to the bottom of straw sandals to prevent noise when sneaking around attacking to the right when surrounded by a large number of enemies throwing charred owl and turtle powder when trying to hide and casting spells it also clarified methods and how to manufacture and use ninjutsu tools such as cane swords and makibishi japanese caltrop roles espionage was the chief role of the ninja with the aid of disguises the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications as well as obtaining passwords and communiques the aforementioned supplement to the nochi kagami briefly describes the ninja s role in espionage concerning ninja they were said to be from iga and k ga and went freely into enemy castles in secret they observed hidden things and were taken as being friends later in history the k ga ninja would become regarded as agents of the tokugawa bakufu at a time when the bakufu used the ninja in an intelligence network to monitor regional daimy s as well as the imperial court sabotage arson was the primary form of sabotage practiced by the ninja who targeted castles and camps the tamon in nikki th century a diary written by abbot eishun of k fuku ji temple describes an arson attack on a castle by men of the iga clans this morning the sixth day of the th month of tenbun the iga shu entered kasagi castle in secret and set fire to a few of the priests quarters they also set fire to outbuildings in various places inside the san no maru they captured the ichi no maru inner bailey and the ni no maru second bailey in rokkaku yoshikata employed a team of ninja to set fire to sawayama castle a ch nin captain led a force of ninja into the castle by means of deception in a technique dubbed bakemono jutsu ghost technique his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy s family crest mon and proceeded to make replicas with the same mon by wielding these lanterns they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight once inside the ninja set fire to the castle and yoshitaka s army would later emerge victorious the mercenary nature of the shinobi is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of sawayama castle in commanders acting under ki awa nagamasa hired three iga ninja of genin rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in maibara rokkaku yoshitaka the same man who had hired iga ninja just years earlier was the fortress holder and target of attack the asai sandaiki writes of their plans we employed shinobi no mono of iga they were contracted to set fire to the castle however the mercenary shinobi were unwilling to take commands when the fire attack did not begin as scheduled the iga men told the commanders who were not from the region that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the shinobi they then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy the fire was eventually set allowing nagamasa s army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush countermeasures a variety of countermeasures were taken to prevent the activities of the ninja precautions were often taken against assassinations such as weapons concealed in the lavatory or under a removable floorboard buildings were constructed with traps and trip wires attached to alarm bells japanese castles were designed to be difficult to navigate with winding routes leading to the inner compound blind spots and holes in walls provided constant surveillance of these labyrinthine paths as exemplified in himeji castle nij castle in kyoto is constructed with long nightingale floors which rested on metal hinges uguisu bari specifically designed to squeak loudly when walked over grounds covered with gravel also provided early notice of unwanted intruders and segregated buildings allowed fires to be better contained famous people many famous people in japanese history have been associated or identified as ninja but their status as ninja is difficult to prove and may be the product of later imagination rumors surrounding famous warriors such as kusunoki masashige or minamoto no yoshitsune sometimes describe them as ninja but there is little evidence for these claims some well known examples include kumawaka the th century a suppa ninja who served obu toramasa a vassal of takeda shingen hattori han a samurai serving under tokugawa ieyasu his ancestry in iga province along with ninjutsu manuals published by his descendants have led some sources to define him as a ninja ishikawa goemon goemon reputedly tried to drip poison from a thread into oda nobunaga s mouth through a hiding spot in the ceiling f ma kotar d a ninja rumored to have killed hattori han with whom he was supposedly rivals the fictional weapon f ma shuriken is named after him momochi sanday th

y ji the professor of mie university and historian nakanishi g announced that they had identified three people who were successful in early modern ureshino including the ninja benkei mus mus is thought to be the same person as denrinb raikei the chinese disciple of marume nagayoshi in popular culture the image of the ninja entered popular culture in the edo period when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived stories about the ninja are usually based on historical figures for instance many similar tales exist about a daimy challenging a ninja to prove his worth usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept novels were written about the ninja such as jiraiya g ketsu monogatari which was also made into a kabuki play fictional figures such as sarutobi sasuke would eventually make their way into comics and television where they have come to enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums ninja appear in many forms of japanese and western popular
