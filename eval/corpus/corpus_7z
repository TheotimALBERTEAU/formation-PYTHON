 is a compressed archive file format that supports several different data compression encryption and pre processing algorithms the format initially appeared as implemented by the ip archiver the ip program is publicly available under the terms of the gnu lesser general public license the l ma sdk was placed in the public domain in december the latest stable version of ip and l ma sdk is version the file format specification is distributed with ip s source code since the specification can be found in plain text format in the doc sub directory of the source code distribution features and enhancements the format provides the following main features open modular architecture that allows any compression conversion or encryption method to be stacked high compression ratios depending on the compression method used aes bit encryption ip legacy encryption large file support up to approximately exbibytes or bytes unicode file names support for solid compression where multiple files of similar type are compressed within a single stream in order to exploit the combined redundancy inherent in similar files compression and encryption of archive headers support for multi part archives e g xxx xxx see the context menu items split file to create them and combine files to re assemble an archive from a set of multi part component files support for custom codec plugin dlls the format s open architecture allows additional future compression methods to be added to the standard compression methods the following compression methods are currently defined l ma a variation of the l algorithm using a sliding dictionary up to gb in length for duplicate string elimination the l stage is followed by entropy coding using a markov chain based range coder and binary trees l ma modified version of l ma providing better multithreading support and less expansion of incompressible data b ip the standard burrows wheeler transform algorithm b ip uses two reversible transformations bwt then move to front with huffman coding for symbol reduction the actual compression element ppmd dmitry shkarin s ppmdh ppmii prediction by partial matching with information inheritance and cppmii complicated ppmii with small changes ppmii is an improved version of the ppm compression algorithm prediction by partial matching deflate standard algorithm based on kb l and huffman coding deflate is found in several file formats including ip g ip png and pdf ip contains a from scratch deflate encoder that frequently beats the de facto standard lib version in compression si e but at the expense of cpu usage a suite of recompression tools called advancecomp contains a copy of the deflate encoder from the ip implementation these utilities can often be used to further compress the si e of existing g ip ip png or mng files pre processing filters the l ma sdk comes with the bcj and bcj preprocessors included so that later stages are able to achieve greater compression for x arm powerpc ppc ia itanium and arm thumb processors jump targets are normali ed before compression by changing relative position into absolute values for x this means that near jumps calls and conditional jumps but not short jumps and conditional jumps are converted from the machine language jump bytes backwards style notation to normali ed jump to address style notation all jumps to perhaps a common subroutine are thus encoded identically making them more compressible bcj converter for bit x executables normalises target addresses of near jumps and calls from relative distances to absolute destinations bcj pre processor for x executables bcj is an improvement on bcj adding additional x jump call instruction processing near jump near call conditional near jump targets are split out and compressed separately in another stream bcj type filters for arm arm arm thumb powerpc sparc delta encoding delta filter basic preprocessor for multimedia data swap swap endianess swap filter encryption the format supports encryption with the aes algorithm with a bit key the key is generated from a user supplied passphrase using an algorithm based on the sha hash function the sha is executed times which causes a significant delay on slow pcs before compression or extraction starts this technique is called key stretching and is used to make a brute force search for the passphrase more difficult current gpu based and custom hardware attacks limit the effectiveness of this particular method of key stretching so it is still important to choose a strong password the format provides the option to encrypt the filenames of a archive limitations the format does not store filesystem permissions such as unix owner group permissions or ntfs acls and hence can be inappropriate for backup archival purposes a workaround on unix like systems for this is to convert data to a tar bitstream before compressing with but gnu tar common in many unix environments can also compress with the l ma algorithm x natively without the use of using the j switch the resulting file extension is tar x or tx and not tar this method of compression has been adopted with many distributions for packaging such as arch debian deb fedora rpm and slackware the older l ma format is less efficient on the other hand it is important to note that tar does not save the filesystem encoding which means that tar compressed filenames can become unreadable if decompressed on a different computer the format does not allow extraction of some broken files that is for example if one has the first segment of a series of files cannot give the start of the files within the archive it must wait until all segments are downloaded the format also lacks recovery records making it vulnerable to data degradation unless used in conjunction with external solutions like parchives or within filesystems with robust error correction by way of comparison ip files also lack a recovery feature while the rar format has one
