sign languages also known as signed languages are languages that use the visual manual modality to convey meaning instead of spoken words sign languages are expressed through manual articulation in combination with non manual markers sign languages are full fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon sign languages are not universal and are usually not mutually intelligible although there are similarities among different sign languages wherever communities of people with hearing challenges or people who experience deafness exist sign languages have developed as useful means of communication and form the core of local deaf cultures although signing is used primarily by the deaf and hard of hearing it is also used by hearing individuals such as those with deaf family members including children of deaf adults sign language should not be confused with body language a type of nonverbal communication linguists also distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or obtained from them such as constructed manual codes for spoken languages home sign baby sign and signs learned by non human primates the number of sign languages worldwide is not precisely known each country generally has its own native sign language and some have more than one the edition of ethnologue lists sign languages while the sign hub atlas of sign language structures lists over and notes that there are more that have not been documented or discovered yet as of indo pakistani sign language is the most used sign language in the world and ethnologue ranks it as the st most spoken language in the world some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition history groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history one of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century bc in plato s cratylus where socrates says if we hadn t a voice or a tongue and wanted to express things to one another wouldn t we try to make signs by moving our hands head and the rest of our body just as dumb people do at present most of what is known about pre th century sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets fingerspelling systems that were invented to facilitate the transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language rather than documentation of the language itself debate around european monastic sign languages developed in the middle ages has come to regard them as gestural systems rather than true sign languages monastic sign languages were the basis for the first known manual alphabet used in deaf schools developed by pedro ponce de le n the earliest records of contact between europeans and indigenous peoples of the gulf coast region in what is now texas and northern mexico note a fully formed sign language already in use by the time of the europeans arrival there these records include the accounts of cabe a de vaca in and coronado in in juan pablo bonet published reducci n de las letras y arte para ense ar a hablar a los mudos reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak in madrid it is considered the first modern treatise of sign language phonetics setting out a method of oral education for deaf people and a manual alphabet in britain manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes such as secret communication public speaking or communication by or with deaf people in john bulwer described master babington a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet contryved on the joynts of his fingers whose wife could converse with him easily even in the dark through the use of tactile signing in george dalgarno published didascalocophus or the deaf and dumb mans tutor in which he presented his own method of deaf education including an arthrological alphabet where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time some have speculated that they can be traced to early ogham manual alphabets the vowels of this alphabet have survived in the modern alphabets used in british sign language auslan and new ealand sign language the earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern two handed alphabet appeared in with digiti lingua latin for language or tongue of the finger a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak he suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes for silence and secrecy or purely for entertainment nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets and letters of the modern two handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of handshapes depicted charles de la fin published a book in describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part e g brow b and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other british systems he described such codes for both english and latin by the british manual alphabet had found more or less its present form descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities at least in education in the former british colonies india australia new ealand uganda and south africa as well as the republics and provinces of the former yugoslavia grand cayman island in the caribbean indonesia norway germany and the united states during the polygar wars against the british veeran sundaralingam communicated with veerapandiya kattabomman s mute younger brother oomaithurai by using their own sign language frenchman charles michel de l p e published his manual alphabet in the th century which has survived largely unchanged in france and north america until the present time in abb de l p e founded the first school for deaf children in paris laurent clerc was arguably its most famous graduate clerc went to the united states with thomas hopkins gallaudet to found the american school for the deaf in hartford connecticut in gallaudet s son edward miner gallaudet founded a school for the deaf in in washington d c which in became the national deaf mute college now called gallaudet university it is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world international sign formerly known as gestuno is used mainly at international deaf events such as the deaflympics and meetings of the world federation of the deaf while recent studies claim that international sign is a kind of a pidgin they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language linguistics sign languages have capability and complexity equal to spoken languages their study as part of the field of linguistics has demonstrated that they exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages such fundamental properties include duality of patterning and recursion duality of patterning means that languages are composed of smaller meaningless units which can be combined into larger units with meaning see below the term recursion means that languages exhibit grammatical rules and the output of such a rule can be the input of the same rule it is for example possible in sign languages to create subordinate clauses and a subordinate clause may contain another subordinate clause sign languages are not mime in other words signs are conventional often arbitrary and do not necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent much as most spoken language is not onomatopoeic while iconicity is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones the difference is not categorical the visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning to be more fully expressive where as this is more suppressed in spoken language sign languages like spoken languages organi e elementary meaningless units into meaningful semantic units this type of organi ation in natural language is often called duality of patterning as in spoken languages these meaningless units are represented as combinations of features although coarser descriptions are often also made in terms of five parameters handshape or handform orientation location or place of articulation movement and non manual expression these meaningless units in sign languages were initially called cheremes from the greek word for hand by analogy to the phonemes from greek for voice of spoken languages now they are sometimes called phonemes when describing sign languages too since the function is essentially the same but more commonly discussed in terms of features or parameters more generally both sign and spoken languages share the characteristics that linguists have found in all natural human languages such as transitoriness semanticity arbitrariness productivity and cultural transmission common linguistic features of many sign languages are the occurrence of classifier constructions a high degree of inflection by means of changes of movement and a topic comment syntax more than spoken languages sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means e g by the use of space two manual articulators and the signer s face and body though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic as these complex constructions function as predicates that may express any or all of the following motion position stative descriptive or handling information the term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms such as depictive signs today linguists study sign languages as true languages part of the field of linguistics however the category sign languages was not added to the linguistic bibliography bibliographie linguistique until the volume when it appeared with entries relationships with spoken languages there is a common misconception that sign languages are spoken language expressed in signs or that they were invented by hearing people similarities in language processing in the brain between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception hearing teachers in deaf schools such as charles michel de l p e or thomas hopkins gallaudet are often incorrectly referred to as inventors of sign language instead sign languages like all natural languages are developed by the people who use them in this case deaf people who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language as a sign language develops it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with sign languages vary in how much they borrow from spoken languages in many sign languages a manual alphabet fingerspelling may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language this is most commonly used for proper names of people and places it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs such as initiali ed signs in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning on the whole though sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development for example british sign language bsl and american sign language asl are quite different and mutually unintelligible even though the hearing people of the united kingdom and the united states share the same spoken language the grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area in fact in terms of syntax asl shares more with spoken japanese than it does with english similarly countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language south africa which has official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages is a good example of this it has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country spatial grammar and simultaneity sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium sight but may also exploit tactile features tactile sign languages spoken language is by and large linear only one sound can be made or received at a time sign language on the other hand is visual and hence can use a simultaneous expression although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information one way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers classifiers allow a signer to spatially show a referent s type si e shape movement or extent the possible simultaneity of sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated the use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints resulting in a large extent of symmetry or signing with one articulator only further sign languages just like spoken languages depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the morphology internal structure of individual signs non manual elements sign languages convey much of their prosody through non manual elements postures or movements of the body head eyebrows eyes cheeks and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information including lexical distinction grammatical structure adjectival or adverbial content and discourse functions at the lexical level signs can be lexically specified for non manual elements in addition to the manual articulation for instance facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion as in the sign for angry in c ech sign language non manual elements may also be lexically contrastive for example in asl american sign language facial components distinguish some signs from other signs an example is the sign translated as not yet which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side in addition to the manual part of the sign without these features the sign would be interpreted as late mouthings which are parts of spoken words accompanying lexical signs can also be contrastive as in the manually identical signs for doctor and battery in sign language of the netherlands while the content of a signed sentence is produced manually many grammatical functions are produced non manually i e with the face and the torso such functions include questions negation relative clauses and topicali ation asl and bsl use similar non manual marking for yes no questions for example they are shown through raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt some adjectival and adverbial information is conveyed through non manual elements but what these elements are varies from language to language for instance in asl a slightly open mouth with the tongue relaxed and visible in the corner of the mouth means carelessly but a similar non manual in bsl means boring or unpleasant discourse functions such as turn taking are largely regulated through head movement and eye ga e since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact iconicity iconicity is similarity or analogy between the form of a sign linguistic or otherwise and its meaning as opposed to arbitrariness the first studies on iconicity in asl were published in the late s and early s many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of sign languages considering most perceived iconicity to be extralinguistic however mimetic aspects of sign language signs that imitate mimic or represent are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages for example when deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties though it never disappears from a particular sign language iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammatici ed as a form becomes more conventional it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community nancy frishberg concluded that though originally present in many signs iconicity is degraded over time through the application of natural grammatical processes in psychologist roger brown was one of the first to suggest that the properties of asl give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory in his study brown found that when a group of six hearing children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than another group of six children that were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties in contrast to brown linguists elissa newport and richard meier found that iconicity appears to have virtually no impact on the acquisition of american sign language a central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that asl was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or english on the hands one of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that real languages must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning thus if asl consisted of signs that had iconic form meaning relationship it could not be considered a real language as a result iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages for a long time however iconicity also plays a role in many spoken languages spoken japanese for example exhibits many words mimicking the sounds of their potential referents see japanese sound symbolism later researchers thus acknowledged that natural languages do not need to consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning the visual nature of sign language simply allows for a greater degree of iconicity compared to spoken languages as most real world objects can be described by a prototypical shape e g a table usually has a flat surface but most real world objects do not make prototypical sounds that can be mimicked by spoken languages e g tables do not make prototypical sounds however sign languages are not fully iconic on the one hand there are also many arbitrary signs in sign languages and on the other hand the grammar of a sign language puts limits to the degree of iconicity all known sign languages for example express lexical concepts via manual signs from a truly iconic language one would expect that a concept like smiling would be expressed by mimicking a smile i e by performing a smiling face all known sign languages however do not express the concept of smiling by a smiling face but by a manual sign the cognitive linguistics perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete real world referent rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign in this view iconicity is grounded in a language user s mental representation construal in cognitive grammar it is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon the cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning in this way the israeli sign language isl sign for ask has parts of its form that are iconic movement away from the mouth means something coming from the mouth and parts that are arbitrary the handshape and the orientation many signs have metaphoric mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones for these signs there are three way correspondences between a form a concrete source and an abstract target meaning the asl sign learn has this three way correspondence the abstract target meaning is learning the concrete source is putting objects into the head from books the form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead the iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source the metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as double mapped classification sign languages may be classified by how they arise in non signing communities home sign is not a full language but closer to a pidgin home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next where they are passed on creoli ation would be expected to occur resulting in a full language however home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language examples include various australian aboriginal sign languages and gestural systems across west africa such as mofu gudur in cameroon a village sign language is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community who have deaf family and friends the most famous of these is probably the extinct martha s vineyard sign language of the u s but there are also numerous village languages scattered throughout africa asia and america deaf community sign languages on the other hand arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities these include school sign such as nicaraguan sign language which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction as well as community languages such as bamako sign language which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment at first deaf community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population in many cases not even by close family members however they may grow in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition as in the case of asl both contrast with speech taboo languages such as the various aboriginal australian sign languages which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf it is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right rather than manual codes of spoken languages though a few such as yolngu sign language are independent of any particular spoken language hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with users of other languages as in plains indian sign language this was a contact signing system or pidgin that was evidently not used by deaf people in the plains nations though it presumably influenced home sign language contact and creoli ation is common in the development of sign languages making clear family classifications difficult it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language or whether there was one or several parent languages such as several village languages merging into a deaf community language contact occurs between sign languages between sign and spoken languages contact sign a kind of pidgin and between sign languages and gestural systems used by the broader community for example adamorobe sign language a village sign language of ghana may be related to the gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout west africa in vocabulary and areal features including prosody and phonetics bsl auslan and n sl are usually considered to be a language known as ban sl maritime sign language and south african sign language are also related to bsl danish sign language and its descendants norwegian sign language and icelandic sign language are largely mutually intelligible with swedish sign language finnish sign language and portuguese sign language derive from swedish sl though with local admixture in the case of mutually unintelligible finnish sl danish sl has french sl influence and wittmann places them in that family though he proposes that swedish finnish and portuguese sl are instead related to british sign language swedish sign language family includes the following languages swedish sign language finnish sign language finland swedish sign language portuguese sign language eritrean sign language and the cape verdian sign language although some reports also say that the s o tom and pr ncipe sign language is largely intelligible with portuguese sign indian sign language isl is similar to pakistani sign language japanese sign language taiwanese sign language and korean sign language are thought to be members of a japanese sign language family french sign language family there are a number of sign languages that emerged from french sign language lsf or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and lsf these include french sign language italian sign language quebec sign language lsq american sign language irish sign language russian sign language dutch sign language ngt spanish sign language mexican sign language bra ilian sign language libras catalan sign language ukrainian sign language austrian sign language along with its twin hungarian sign language and its offspring c ech sign language and others a subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by american sign language asl or are regional varieties of asl bolivian sign language is sometimes considered a dialect of asl thai sign language is a mixed language derived from asl and the native sign languages of bangkok and chiang mai and may be considered part of the asl family others possibly influenced by asl include ugandan sign language kenyan sign language philippine sign language and malaysian sign language according to an sil report the sign languages of russia moldova and ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language or distinct related languages the same report suggested a cluster of sign languages centered around c ech sign language hungarian sign language and slovak sign language this group may also include romanian bulgarian and polish sign languages german sign language dgs gave rise to polish sign language it also at least strongly influenced israeli sign language though it is unclear whether the latter derives from dgs or from austrian sign language which is in the french family the southern dialect of chinese sign language gave rise to hong kong sign language used in hong kong and macau lyons sign language may be the source of flemish sign language vgt though this is unclear sign languages of jordan lebanon syria palestine and iraq and possibly saudi arabia may be part of a sprachbund or may be one dialect of a larger eastern arabic sign language known isolates include nicaraguan sign language turkish sign language armenian sign language kata kolok al sayyid bedouin sign language and providence island sign language the only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to the classification is based on the sign languages from the edition of ethnologue that were known at the time of the conference on sign languages in montreal and more languages the author added after the conference in his classification the author distinguishes between primary and auxiliary sign languages as well as between single languages and names that are thought to refer to more than one language the prototype a class of languages includes all those sign languages that seemingly cannot be derived from any other language prototype r languages are languages that are remotely modelled on a prototype a language in many cases thought to have been french sign language by a process kroeber called stimulus diffusion the families of bsl dgs jsl lsf and possibly lsg were the products of creoli ation and relexification of prototype languages creoli ation is seen as enriching overt morphology in sign languages as compared to reducing overt morphology in spoken languages typology sign languages vary in word order typology for example austrian sign language japanese sign language and indo pakistani sign language are subject object verb while asl is subject verb object influence from the surrounding spoken languages is plausible sign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification for a similar group of intransitive verbs especially motion verbs it is the subject which is incorporated only in a very few sign languages for instance japanese sign language are agents ever incorporated in this way since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern brentari classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication visual instead of auditory as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic that means that one syllable i e one word one sign can express several morphemes e g subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb s movement inflection another aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for cardinal numbers typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages acquisition children who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language in a study done at mcgill university they found that american sign language users who acquired the language natively from birth performed better when asked to copy videos of asl sentences than asl users who acquired the language later in life they also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of asl sentences between the two groups all suggesting that there is an important critical period in learning signed languages the acquisition of non manual features follows an interesting pattern when a word that always has a particular non manual feature associated with it such as a wh question word is learned the non manual aspects are attached to the word but do not have the flexibility associated with adult use at a certain point the non manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression after a few months the non manuals reappear this time being used the way adult signers would use them written forms sign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form many deaf people do not see a need to write their own language several ways to represent sign languages in written form have been developed stokoe notation devised by dr william stokoe for his dictionary of american sign language is an abstract phonemic notation system designed specifically for representing the use of the hands it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non manual features of sign languages however it was designed for research particularly in a dictionary not for general use the hamburg notation system hamnosys developed in the early s is a detailed phonetic system not designed for any one sign language and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script david j peterson has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is ascii friendly known as the sign language international phonetic alphabet slipa signwriting developed by valerie sutton in is a system for representing sign languages phonetically including mouthing facial expression and dynamics of movement the script is sometimes used for detailed research language documentation as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages si s is another orthography which is largely phonemic however a few signs are logographs and or ideographs due to regional variation in sign languages asl phabet is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by dr sam supalla which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of handshape location movement many signs can be written the same way homograph the alphabetic writing system for sign languages sistema de escritura alfab tica sea by its spanish name and acronym developed by linguist ngel herrero blanco and two deaf researchers juan jos alfaro and inmacualada cascales was published as a book in and made accessible in spanish sign language on line this system makes use of the letters of the latin alphabet with a few diacritics to represent sign through the morphemic sequence s l c q d f bimanual sign place contact handshape direction and internal form the resulting words are meant to be read by signing the system is designed to be applicable to any sign language with minimal modification and to be usable through any medium without special equipment or software non manual elements can be encoded to some extent but the authors argue that the system does not need to represent all elements of a sign to be practical the same way written oral language does not the system has seen some updates which are kept publicly on a wiki page the center for linguistic normali ation of spanish sign language has made use of sea to transcribe all signs on its dictionary so far there is no consensus regarding the written form of sign language except for signwriting none are widely used maria galea writes that signwriting is becoming widespread uncontainable and untraceable in the same way that works written in and about a well developed writing system such as the latin script the time has arrived where sw is so widespread that it is impossible in the same way to list all works that have been produced using this writing system and that have been written about this writing system for example in at the federal university of santa catarina jo o paulo ampessan wrote his linguistics master s dissertation in bra ilian sign language using sutton signwriting in his dissertation the writing of grammatical non manual expressions in sentences in libras using the signwriting system ampessan states that the data indicate the need for non manual expressions usage in writing sign language sign perception for a native signer sign perception influences how the mind makes sense of their visual language experience for example a handshape may vary based on the other signs made before or after it but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development the mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category different handshapes are stored in other categories the mind ignores some of the similarities between different perceptual categories at the same time preserving the visual information within each perceptual category of handshape variation in society deaf communities and deaf culture when deaf people constitute a relatively small proportion of the general population deaf communities often develop that are distinct from the surrounding hearing community these deaf communities are very widespread in the world associated especially with sign languages used in urban areas and throughout a nation and the cultures they have developed are very rich one example of sign language variation in the deaf community is black asl this sign language was developed in the black deaf community as a variant during the american era of segregation and racism where young black deaf students were forced to attend separate schools than their white deaf peers use of sign languages in hearing communities on occasion where the prevalence of deaf people is high enough a deaf sign language has been taken up by an entire local community forming what is sometimes called a village sign language or shared signing community typically this happens in small tightly integrated communities with a closed gene pool famous examples include martha s vineyard sign language united states al sayyid bedouin sign language israel kata kolok bali adamorobe sign language ghana yucatec maya sign language mexico in such communities deaf people are generally well integrated in the general community and not socially disadvantaged so much so that it is difficult to speak of a separate deaf community many australian aboriginal sign languages arose in a context of extensive speech taboos such as during mourning and initiation rites they are or were especially highly developed among the warlpiri warumungu dieri kaytetye arrernte and warlmanpa and are based on their respective spoken languages a sign language arose among tribes of american indians in the great plains region of north america see plains indian sign language before european contact it was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken languages as well as by deaf people there are especially users today among the crow cheyenne and arapaho sign language is also used as a form of alternative or augmentative communication by people who can hear but have difficulties using their voices to speak increasingly hearing schools and universities are expressing interest in incorporating sign language in the u s enrollment for asl american sign language classes as part of students choice of second language is on the rise in new ealand one year after the passing of n sl act in parliament a n sl curriculum was released for schools to take n sl as an optional subject the curriculum and teaching materials were designed to target intermediate schools from years to n herald legal recognition some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition while others have no status at all sarah batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recogni ed and supported not merely as an accommodation for those with disabilities but as the communication medium of language communities legal requirements covering sign language accessibility in media vary from country to country in the united kingdom the broadcasting act addressed the requirements for blind and deaf viewers but has since been replaced by the communications act interpretation in order to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people sign language interpreters are often used such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own syntax different from any spoken language the interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country such as french sign language lsf and spoken french in france spanish sign language lse to spoken spanish in spain british sign language bsl and spoken english in the u k and american sign language asl and spoken english in the u s and most of anglophone canada since bsl and asl are distinct sign languages both used in english speaking countries etc sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired such as between lse and english are also available albeit less frequently sign language is sometimes provided for television programmes that include speech the signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen with the programme being broadcast full si e or slightly shrunk away from that corner typically for press conferences such as those given by the mayor of new york city the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time live sign interpretation of important televised events is increasingly common but still an informal industry in traditional analogue broadcasting some programmes are repeated outside main viewing hours with a signer present some emerging television technologies allow the viewer to turn the signer on and off in a similar manner to subtitles and closed captioning technology one of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when at t s videophone trademarked as the picturephone was introduced to the public at the new york world s fair two deaf users were able to freely communicate with each other between the fair and another city however video communication did not become widely available until sufficient bandwidth for the high volume of video data became available in the early s the internet now allows deaf people to talk via a video link either with a special purpose videophone designed for use with sign language or with off the shelf video services designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer webcam the special videophones that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than off the shelf services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximi e the intelligibility of sign languages some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person s video camera in order to oom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing interpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but since the technological advancements in the early s provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available in video remote interpreting vri the two clients a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other are in one location and the interpreter is in another the interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link and with the hearing person by an audio link vri can be used for situations in which no on site interpreters are available however vri cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone with video relay service vrs the sign language user the interpreter and the hearing person are in three separate locations thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter with recent developments in artificial intelligence in computer science some recent deep learning based machine translation algorithms have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language directly to written language sign language has been incorporated into film for example all movies shown in bra ilian movie theaters must have a bra ilian sign language video track available to play alongside the film via a second screen sign union flag the sign union flag was designed by arnaud balard after studying flags around the world and vexillology principles for two years balard revealed the design of the flag featuring the styli ed outline of a hand the three colors which make up the flag design are representative of deafhood and humanity dark blue sign language turquoise and enlightenment and hope yellow balard intended the flag to be an international symbol which welcomes deaf people language endangerment and extinction as with any spoken language sign languages are also vulnerable to becoming endangered for example a sign language used by a small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users shift to a sign language used by a larger community as has happened with hawai i sign language which is almost extinct except for a few elderly signers even nationally recognised sign languages can be endangered for example new ealand sign language is losing users methods are being developed to assess the language vitality of sign languages communication systems similar to sign language there are a number of communication systems that are similar in some respects to sign languages while not having all the characteristics of a full sign language particularly its grammatical structure many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them manual codes for spoken languages when deaf and hearing people interact signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language in particular when people devise one for one sign for word correspondences between spoken words or even morphemes and signs that represent them the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language rather than a natural sign language such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach deaf children the spoken language and generally are not used outside an educational context baby sign language with hearing children some hearing parents teach signs to young hearing children since the muscles in babies hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths signs are seen as a beneficial option for better communication babies can usually produce signs before they can speak this reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants when the child begins to speak signing is usually abandoned so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language this is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with deaf parents who generally acquire the full sign language natively the same as deaf children of deaf parents home sign informal rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family for instance when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child the child may develop a system of signs naturally unless repressed by the parents the term for these mini languages is home sign sometimes kitchen sign home sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs still this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language no type of home sign is recogni ed as a full language primate use there have been several notable examples of scientists teaching signs to non human primates in order to communicate with humans such as chimpan ees gorillas and orangutans however linguists generally point out that this does not constitute knowledge of a human language as a complete system rather than simply signs words notable examples of animals who have learned signs include chimpan ees washoe

later shifted to speech an important question for this gestural theory is what caused the shift to vocali ation
