karate japanese pronunciation ka ate okinawan pronunciation ka ati also karate do karate d is a martial art developed in the ryukyu kingdom it developed from the indigenous ryukyuan martial arts called te hand t in okinawan under the influence of chinese martial arts while modern karate is primarily a striking art that uses punches and kicks traditional karate training also employs throwing and joint locking techniques a karate practitioner is called a karate ka beginning in the s early chinese martial artists brought their techniques to okinawa despite the ryukyu kingdom being turned into a puppet state by japanese samurai in after the invasion of ryukyu its cultural ties to china remained strong since ryukyuans were banned from carrying swords under samurai rule groups of young aristocrats created unarmed combat methods as a form of resistance combining chinese and local styles of martial arts training emphasi ed self discipline this blend of martial arts became known as kara te which translates to chinese hand initially there were no uniforms colored belts ranking systems or standardi ed styles many elements essential to modern karate were actually incorporated a century ago the ryukyu kingdom had been conquered by the japanese satsuma domain and had become its vassal state since but was formally annexed to the empire of japan in as okinawa prefecture the ryukyuan samurai okinawan samur who had been the bearers of karate lost their privileged position and with it karate was in danger of losing transmission however karate gradually regained popularity after when it began to be taught in schools in okinawa during the taish era karate was initially introduced to mainland japan by ank itosu and then by his students gichin funakoshi and motobu ch ki the ultranationalistic sentiment of the s affected every aspect of japanese culture to make the imported martial art more relatable funakoshi incorporated elements from judo such as the training uniforms colored belts and ranking systems karate s popularity was initially sluggish with little exposition but when a maga ine reported a story about motobu defeating a foreign boxer in kyoto karate rapidly became well known throughout japan in this era of escalating japanese militarism the name was changed from chinese hand or tang hand to empty hand both of which are pronounced karate in japanese to indicate that the japanese wished to develop the combat form in japanese style after world war ii okinawa became an important united states military site and karate became popular among servicemen stationed there the martial arts movies of the s and s served to greatly increase the popularity of martial arts around the world and english speakers began to use the word karate in a generic way to refer to all striking based asian martial arts karate schools d j s began appearing around the world catering to those with casual interest as well as those seeking a deeper study of the art karate do like most japanese martial arts is considered to be not only about fighting techniques but also about spiritual cultivation many karate schools and d j s have established rules called d j kun which emphasi e the perfection of character the importance of effort and respect for courtesy karate featured at the summer olympics after its inclusion at the games was supported by the international olympic committee web japan sponsored by the japanese ministry of foreign affairs claims that karate has million practitioners worldwide while the world karate federation claims there are million practitioners around the world etymology originally in okinawa during the ryukyu kingdom period there existed an indigenous ryukyuan martial art called te okinawan t lit hand furthermore in the th century a chinese derived martial art called t de okinawan t d lit tang hand emerged according to gichin funakoshi a distinction between okinawan te and t de existed in the late th century with the emergence of t de it is thought that te also came to be called okinawa te okinawan uchin d lit okinawa hand however this distinction gradually became blurred with the decline of okinawa te around when karate began to be taught in public schools in okinawa t de was read kun yomi and called karate lit tang hand in the japanese style both t de and karate are written in the same chinese characters meaning tang china hand but the former is on yomi chinese reading and the latter is kun yomi japanese reading since the distinction between okinawa te and t de was already blurred at that time karate was used to encompass both kara is a kun yomi for the character t in on yomi which is derived from an alternate spelling of kaya confederacy and later included things deriving from china specifically from the tang dynasty therefore t de and karate tang hand differ in the scope of meaning of the words japan sent envoys to the tang dynasty and introduced much chinese culture gichin funakoshi proposed that t de karate may have been used instead of te as tang became a synonym for luxury imported goods according to gichin funakoshi the word pronounced karate existed in the ryukyu kingdom period but it is unclear whether it meant tang hand or empty hand the chinese origins of karate were increasingly viewed with suspicion due to rising tensions between china and japan and as well as the looming threat of a full scale war between the two countries in the japanese character for karate was altered to a homophone a word pronounced identically but with a different meaning thus chinese hand was replaced with empty hand but this name change did not immediately spread among okinawan karate practitioners there were many karate practitioners such as ch jun miyagi who still used te in everyday conversation until world war ii when karate was first taught in mainland japan in the s gichin funakoshi and motobu ch ki used the name karate jutsu lit tang hand art along with karate the word jutsu means art or technique and in those days it was often used as a suffix to the name of each martial art as in jujutsu and kenjutsu swordsmanship the first documented use of a homophone of the logogram pronounced kara by replacing the chinese character meaning tang dynasty with the character meaning empty took place in karate kumite written in august by ch mo hanashiro in mainland japan karate empty hand gradually began to be used from the writings of gichin funakoshi and motobu ch ki in the s in the karate study group of keio university instructor gichin funakoshi used this term in reference to the concept of emptiness in the heart sutra and this terminology was later populari ed especially in tokyo there is also a theory that the background for this name change was the worsening of japan china relations at the time on october a roundtable meeting of karate masters was held in naha okinawa prefecture and it was officially resolved to use the name karate empty hand in the sense of k shu k ken lit without anything in the hands or fists to commemorate this day the okinawa prefectural assembly passed a resolution in to decide october as karate day another nominal development is the addition of d to the end of the word karate d is a suffix having numerous meanings including road path route and way it is used in many martial arts that survived japan s transition from feudal culture to modern times it implies that these arts are not just fighting systems but contain spiritual elements when promoted as disciplines in this context d is usually translated as the way of examples include aikido judo ky d and kendo thus karated is more than just empty hand techniques it is the way of the empty hand since the s the term karate has been written in katakana instead of chinese characters mainly by kyokushin karate founder masutatsu oyama in japan katakana is mainly used for foreign words giving kyokushin karate a modern and new impression history origin there are several theories regarding the origins of karate but the main ones are as follows theory of development from m kata in okinawa there was an ancient martial dance called m kata the dancers danced to the accompaniment of songs and sanshin music similar to karate kata in the okinawan countryside m kata remained until the early th century there is a theory that from this m kata with martial elements te okinawan t hand was born and developed into karate this theory is advocated by ank asato and his student gichin funakoshi theory of introduction by thirty six families from min it is said that in a group of professional people known as the thirty six families from min migrated to kume village now kume naha city in naha from fujian province in the ming dynasty at that time they brought with them advanced learning and skills to ryukyu and there is a theory that chinese kenp the origin of karate was also brought to ryukyu at this time there is also the keich import theory which states that karate was brought to ryukyu after the invasion of ryukyu by the satsuma domain keich as well as the theory that it was introduced by k sh kun okinawan k sank based on the description in shima writing other theories there are also other theories such as that it developed from okinawan sumo shima or that it originated from jujutsu which had been introduced from japan okinawa th th centuries the reason for the development of unarmed combat techniques in ryukyu has conventionally been attributed to a policy of banning weapons which is said to have been implemented on two occasions the first was during the reign of king sh shin r when weapons were collected from all over the country and strictly controlled by the royal government the second time was after the invasion of ryukyu by the satsuma domain in through the two policies the popular belief that ryukyuan samurai who were deprived of their weapons developed karate to compete with satsuma s samurai has traditionally been referred to as if it were a historical fact but in recent years many researchers have questioned the causal relationship between the policy of banning weapons and the development of karate for example as the basis for king sh shin s policy of banning weapons an inscription on the parapet of the main hall of shuri castle which states that swords bows and arrows are to be piled up exclusively as weapons of national defense has been conventionally interpreted as meaning weapons were collected and sealed in a warehouse however in recent years researchers of okinawan studies have pointed out that the correct interpretation is that swords bows and arrows were collected and used as weapons of the state it is also known that the policy of banning weapons a notice to the ryukyu royal government which is said to have been implemented by the satsuma domain only prohibited the carrying of swords and other weapons but not their possession and was a relatively lax regulation this notice stated the possession of guns is prohibited the possession of weapons owned privately by princes three magistrates and samurai is permitted weapons must be repaired in satsuma through the magistrate s office of satsuma swords must be reported to the magistrate s office of satsuma for approval it did not prohibit the possession of weapons except guns or even their practice in fact even after subjugation to the satsuma domain a number of ryukyuan masters of swordsmanship spearmanship archery and other arts are known therefore some researchers critici e the theory that karate developed due to the policy of banning weapons as a rumor on the street with no basis at all karate began as a common fighting system known as te okinawan t among the ryukyuan samurai class there were few formal styles of te but rather many practitioners with their own methods one surviving example is motobu udund lit motobu palace hand which has been handed down to this day in the motobu family one of the branches of the former ryukyu royal family in the th century the ryukyuan history book ky y established around mentions that ky ahagon jikki a favored retainer of king sh shin used a martial art called karate lit empty hand to smash both legs of an assassin this karate is thought to refer to te not today s karate and ank asato introduces ky ahagon as a prominent martial artist th century however some believe that ky ahagon s anecdote is a half legend and that it is unclear whether he was actually a te master in the th century the names of nishinda u kata gushikawa u kata and ch ken makabe are known as masters of te nishinda u kata and gushikawa u kata were martial artists active during the reign of king sh kei reigned nishinda u kata was good at spear as well as te and gushikawa u kata was also good at wooden sword swordsmanship ch ken makabe was a man of the late th century his light stature and jumping ability gave him the nickname makabe ch n gw lit little fighting cock as he was like a ch n fighting cock the ceiling of his house is said to have been marked by his kicking foot it is known that in shima writing written by yoshihiro tobe a confucian scholar of the tosa domain who interviewed ryukyuan samurai who had drifted to tosa present day k chi prefecture there is a description of a martial art called kumiai jutsu performed by k sh kun okinawan k sank it is believed that k sh kun may have been a military officer on a mission from qing that visited ryukyu in and some believe that karate originated with k sh kun in addition the will part i part ii of ryukyuan samurai aka p chin chokushki mentions the name of a martial art called karamut along with japanese jigen ry swordsmanship and jujutsu indicating that ryukyuan samurai practiced these arts in the th century in the japanese satsuma domain invaded ryukyu and ryukyu became its vassal state but it continued to pay tribute to the ming and qing dynasties in china at the time china had implemented a policy of sea ban and only traded with tributary countries so the satsuma domain wanted ryukyu to continue its tribute to benefit from it the envoys of the tribute mission were chosen from among the samurai class of ryukyu and they went to fu hou in fujian and stayed there for six months to a year and a half government funded and privately funded foreign students were also sent to study in beijing or fu hou for several years some of these envoys and students studied chinese martial arts in china the styles of chinese martial arts they studied are not known for certain but it is assumed that they studied fujian white crane and other styles from fujian province s ryo ts shin monk ts shin active during the reign of king sh kei was a monk who went to the qing dynasty to study chinese martial arts and was reportedly one of the best martial artists of his time in ryukyu th and early th century it is not known when the name t de lit tang hand first came into use in the ryukyu kingdom but according to ank asato it was populari ed from kanga sakugawa who was nicknamed t de sakugawa sakugawa was a samurai from shuri who traveled to qing china to learn chinese martial arts the martial arts he mastered were new and different from te as t de was spread by sakugawa traditional te became distinguished as okinawa te lit okinawa hand and gradually faded away as it merged with t de it is generally believed that today s karate is a result of the synthesis of te okinawa te and t de funakoshi writes in the early modern era when china was highly revered many martial artists traveled to china to practice chinese kenpo and added it to the ancient kenpo the so called okinawa te after further study they discarded the disadvantages of both adopted their advantages and added more subtlety and karate was born early styles of karate are often generali ed as shuri te naha te and tomari te named after the three cities from which they emerged each area and its teachers had particular kata techniques and principles that distinguished their local version of te from the others around the s matsumura s kon began teaching okinawa te matsumura was according to one theory a student of sakugawa matsumura s style later became the origin of many shuri te schools itosu ank studied under matsumura and bushi nagahama of naha te he created the pin an forms heian in japanese which are simplified kata for beginning students in itosu helped to get karate introduced into okinawa s public schools these forms were taught to children at the elementary school level itosu s influence in karate is broad the forms he created are common across nearly all styles of karate his students became some of the most well known karate masters including motobu ch y motobu ch ki yabu kents hanashiro ch mo gichin funakoshi and kenwa mabuni itosu is sometimes referred to as the grandfather of modern karate in higaonna kanry returned from china after years of instruction with ryu ryu ko and founded what would become naha te one of his students was the founder of goj ry ch jun miyagi ch jun miyagi taught such well known karateka as seko higa who also trained with higaonna meitoku yagi miya ato ei ichi and seikichi toguchi and for a very brief time near the end of his life an ichi miyagi a teacher claimed by morio higaonna in addition to the three early te styles of karate a fourth okinawan influence is that of uechi kanbun at the age of he went to fu hou in fujian province china to escape japanese military conscription while there he studied under sh shiwa chinese hou ihe he was a leading figure of chinese nanpa shorin ken style at that time he later developed his own style of uechi ry karate based on the sanchin seisan and sanseiryu kata that he had studied in china japan when sh tai the last king of the ry ky kingdom was ordered to move to tokyo in he was accompanied by prominent karate masters such as ank asato and ch fu kyan father of ch toku kyan it is unknown if they taught karate to the japanese in tokyo although there are records that kyan taught his son karate in students from the okinawa prefectural middle school gave a karate demonstration at butokuden in kyoto which was also witnessed by kan jigor founder of judo in may gichin funakoshi founder of shotokan presented pictures of karate on two hanging scrolls at the first physical education exhibition in tokyo the following june funakoshi was invited to the kodokan to give a karate demonstration in front of jigoro kano and other judo experts this was the beginning of the full scale introduction of karate in tokyo in november motobu ch ki founder of motobu ry participated in a judo versus boxing match in kyoto defeating a foreign boxer the match was featured in japan s largest maga ine king which had a circulation of about one million at the time and karate and motobu s name became instantly known throughout japan in funakoshi published the first book on karate and in motobu published the first technical book on kumite sparring as karate s popularity grew karate clubs were established one after another in japanese universities with funakoshi and motobu as instructors in the showa era other okinawan karate masters also came to mainland japan to teach karate these included kenwa mabuni ch jun miyagi kanken t yama and kanbun uechi with the rise of militarism in japan some karate masters gradually came to consider the name karate lit tang hand undesirable the name karate lit empty hand had already been used by ch mo hanashiro in okinawa in and funakoshi decided to use this name as well in addition the name karated lit the way of the tang hand which was already used by the karate club of tokyo imperial university now the university of tokyo in by adding the suffix d way to karate was also used by funakoshi who decided to use the name karated lit the way of the empty hand in the same way the d suffix implies that karated is a path to self knowledge not just a study of the technical aspects of fighting like most martial arts practised in japan karate made its transition from jutsu to d around the beginning of the th century the d in karate d sets it apart from karate jutsu as aikido is distinguished from aikijutsu judo from jujutsu kendo from kenjutsu and iaido from iaijutsu in karate was officially recogni ed as a japanese martial art by the dai nippon butoku kai but initially belonged to the jujutsu division and title examinations were conducted by jujutsu masters in funakoshi changed the names of many kata and karate itself funakoshi s motivation was that the names of many of the traditional kata were unintelligible and that it would be inappropriate to use the chinese style names to teach karate as a japanese martial art he also said that the kata had to be simplified to spread karate as a form of physical education so some of the kata were modified he always referred to what he taught as simply karate but in he built a d j in tokyo and the style he left behind is usually called shotokan after this d j shoto meaning pine wave was funakoshi s pen name and kan meaning hall on october a roundtable meeting of karate masters was held in naha okinawa prefecture where it was officially decided to change the name of karate from karate tang hand to karate empty hand in attendance were ch mo hanashiro ch ki motobu ch toku kyan j hatsu kyoda ch jun miyagi shinpan gusukuma and ch shin chibana in the okinawa prefectural assembly passed a resolution to commemorate this decision by designating october as karate day the moderni ation and systemi ation of karate in japan also included the adoption of the white uniform that consisted of the dogi or keikogi mostly called just karategi and coloured belt ranks both of these innovations were originated and populari ed by jigoro kano the founder of judo and one of the men funakoshi consulted in his efforts to moderni e karate at that time there was almost no kumite training in karate and kata training was the main focus there were also no matches however at that time judo and kendo matches were already being held in mainland japan and randori lit free style practice practice was also being actively practiced the young people in mainland japan gradually became dissatisfied with kata only practice in pre world war ii okinawa karateka practiced iri kumi okinawan for kumite allowing all kinds of techniques strikes choke holds joint locks etc but in a controlled manner to not injure the opponent when aiming to vital areas despite sparring was originally an unnoticed form of practice for senior students there were no contests until western style competitions were introduced to japan gichin funakoshi stated there are no contests in karate shigeru egami relates that during his visit to okinawa in he heard some karateka were ousted from their d j because they adopted sparring after having learned it in tokyo in the early s pre arranged sparring was introduced and developed and finally a few years later free sparring was permitted for shotokan students according to yasuhiro konishi kata only training was often critici ed by the leading judo practitioners of the time such as shuichi nagaoka and hajime isogai who said the karate you do cannot be understood from kata alone so why don t you try a little more so that the general public can understand it against the backdrop of these complaints and criticisms young people such as hironori tsuka and konishi devised their own kumite and kumite matches which are the prototypes of today s kumite motobu s emphasis on kumite attracted tsuka and konishi who later studied okinawan kumite under him after world war ii karate activities were temporarily stalled due to the notice banning judo kendo and other martial arts issued by the ministry of education under the directive of the supreme commander for the allied powers however because this notice did not include the word karate it was interpreted by the ministry of education that karate was not prohibited and karate was able to resume its activities earlier than other martial arts a new form of karate called kyokushin was formally founded in by masutatsu oyama who was born a korean choi yeong eui kyokushin is largely a synthesis of shotokan and g j ry it teaches a curriculum that emphasi es aliveness physical toughness and full contact sparring because of its emphasis on physical full force sparring kyokushin is now often called full contact karate or knockdown karate after the name for its competition rules many other karate organi ations and styles are descended from the kyokushin curriculum practice karate can be practiced as an art bud self defense or as a combat sport traditional karate places emphasis on self development bud modern japanese style training emphasi es the psychological elements incorporated into a proper kokoro attitude such as perseverance fearlessness virtue and leadership skills sport karate places emphasis on exercise and competition weapons are an important training activity in some styles of karate karate training is commonly divided into kihon basics or fundamentals kata forms and kumite sparring kihon kihon means basics and these form the base for everything else in the style including stances strikes punches kicks and blocks karate styles place varying importance on kihon typically this is training in unison of a technique or a combination of techniques by a group of karateka kihon may also be prearranged drills in smaller groups or in pairs kata kata means literally shape or model kata is a formali ed sequence of movements which represent various offensive and defensive postures these postures are based on ideali ed combat applications the applications when applied in a demonstration with real opponents is referred to as a bunkai the bunkai shows how every stance and movement is used bunkai is a useful tool to understand a kata to attain a formal rank the karateka must demonstrate competent performance of specific required kata for that level the japanese terminology for grades or ranks is commonly used requirements for examinations vary among schools kumite sparring in karate is called kumite it literally means meeting of hands kumite is practiced both as a sport and as self defense training levels of physical contact during sparring vary considerably full contact karate has several variants knockdown karate such as kyokushin uses full power techniques to bring an opponent to the ground sparring in armour bogu kumite allows full power techniques with some safety sport kumite in many international competition under the world karate federation is free or structured with light contact or semi contact and points are awarded by a referee in structured kumite yakusoku prearranged two participants perform a choreographed series of techniques with one striking while the other blocks the form ends with one devastating technique hito tsuki in free sparring jiyu kumite the two participants have a free choice of scoring techniques the allowed techniques and contact level are primarily determined by sport or style organi ation policy but might be modified according to the age rank and sex of the participants depending upon style take downs sweeps and in some rare cases even time limited grappling on the ground are also allowed free sparring is performed in a marked or closed area the bout runs for a fixed time to minutes the time can run continuously iri kume or be stopped for referee judgment in light contact or semi contact kumite points are awarded based on the criteria good form sporting attitude vigorous application awareness anshin good timing and correct distance in full contact karate kumite points are based on the results of the impact rather than the formal appearance of the scoring technique d j kun in the bushid tradition d j kun is a set of guidelines for karateka to follow these guidelines apply both in the d j training hall and in everyday life conditioning okinawan karate uses supplementary training known as hojo undo this uses simple equipment made of wood and stone the makiwara is a striking post the nigiri game is a large jar used for developing grip strength these supplementary exercises are designed to increase strength stamina speed and muscle coordination sport karate emphasi es aerobic exercise anaerobic exercise power agility flexibility and stress management all practices vary depending upon the school and the teacher sport karate is divided into style organi ations these organi ations sometimes cooperate in non style specific sport karate organi ations or federations examples of sport organi ations include aakf itkf aok tkl aka wkf nwuko wukf and wkc organi ations hold competitions tournaments from local to international level tournaments are designed to match members of opposing schools or styles against one another in kata sparring and

include everything learned at that point or just new information the demonstration is an application for new rank shinsa and may include basics kata bunkai self defense routines tameshiwari breaking and kumite sparring philosophy in karate do kyohan funakoshi quoted from the heart sutra which is prominent in shingon buddhism form is emptiness emptiness is form itself shiki oku e k k oku e shiki he interpreted the kara of karate d to mean to purge oneself of selfish and evil thoughts for only with a clear mind and conscience can the practitioner understand the knowledge which he receives funakoshi believed that one should be inwardly humble and outwardly gentle only by behaving humbly can one be open to karate s many lessons this is done by listening and being receptive to criticism he considered courtesy of prime importance he said that karate is properly applied only in those rare situations in which one really must either down another or be downed by him funakoshi did not consider it unusual for a devotee to use karate in a real physical confrontation no more than perhaps once in a lifetime he stated that karate practitioners must never be easily drawn into a fight it is understood that one blow from a real expert could mean death it is clear that those who misuse what they have learned bring dishonor upon themselves he promoted the character trait of personal conviction in time of grave public crisis one must have the courage to face a million and one opponents he taught that indecisiveness is a weakness styles karate is divided into many styles each with their different training methods focuses and cultures though they mainly originate from the historical okinawan parent styles of naha te tomari te and shuri te however some of the schools founders have been sceptical about the division of karate into many styles gichin funakoshi simply stated that there are as many styles as instructors in the world while kenwa mabuni explained that the notion of different variations of karate came from outsiders even before the karate populari ation in mainland japan it was spread the idea that karate was divided into two branches sh rei ry roughly what is known as naha te and sh rin ry also classified as shuri te and tomari te though the latter somewhat lying in between but ch jun miyagi believed that was just a wrong perception kanken t yama disregarded that idea as he supported the non school principle mas oyama was actively opposed to the idea of the fragmentation into several karate schools he believed that making karate a combat sport as well keeping it as a martial art could be a possible approach to unify all schools as of s the four main schools of karate in mainland japan were considered to be g j ry shotokan shit ry and wad ry
