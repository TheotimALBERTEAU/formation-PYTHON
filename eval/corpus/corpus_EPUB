epub is an e book file format that uses the epub file extension the term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styli ed as epub epub is supported by many e readers and compatible software is available for most smartphones tablets and computers epub is a technical standard published by the international digital publishing forum idpf it became an official standard of the idpf in september superseding the older open ebook oeb standard the book industry study group endorses epub as the format of choice for packaging content and has stated that the global book publishing industry should rally around a single standard technically a file in the epub format is a ip archive file consisting of xhtml files carrying the content along with images and other supporting files epub is the most widely supported vendor independent xml based e book format it is supported by almost all hardware readers and many software readers and mobile apps history a successor to the open ebook publication structure epub was approved in october with a maintenance update approved in september the epub specification became effective in october superseded by a minor maintenance update in june new major features include support for precise layout or speciali ed formatting fixed layout documents such as for comic books and mathml support the current version of epub is effective may the text of format specification underwent reorgani ation and clean up format supports remotely hosted resources and new font formats woff and sfnt and uses more pure html and css in may idpf members approved world wide web consortium w c merger to fully align the publishing industry and core web technology version epub was approved in october with a maintenance update intended to clarify and correct errata in the specifications being approved in september epub version consists of three specifications open publication structure ops contains the formatting of its content open packaging format opf describes the structure of the epub file in xml open container format ocf collects all files as a ip archive epub internally uses xhtml or dtbook an xml standard provided by the daisy consortium to represent the text and structure of the content document and a subset of css to provide layout and formatting xml is used to create the document manifest table of contents and epub metadata finally the files are bundled in a ip file as a packaging format open publication structure an epub file uses xhtml or dtbook to construct the content of a book as of version this is different from previous versions oebps and earlier which used a subset of xhtml there are however a few restrictions on certain elements the mime type for xhtml documents in epub is application xhtml xml styling and layout are performed using a subset of css referred to as ops style sheets this speciali ed syntax requires that reading systems support only a portion of css properties and adds a few custom properties custom properties include oeb page head oeb page foot and oeb column number font embedding can be accomplished using the font face property as well as including the font file in the opf s manifest see below the mime type for css documents in epub is text css epub also requires that png jpeg gif and svg images be supported using the mime types image png image jpeg image gif image svg xml other media types are allowed but creators must include alternative renditions using supported types for a table of all required mime types see section of the specification unicode is required and content producers must use either utf or utf encoding this is to support international and multilingual books however reading systems are not required to provide the fonts necessary to display every unicode character though they are required to display at least a placeholder for characters that cannot be displayed fully an example skeleton of an xhtml file for epub looks like this open packaging format the opf specification s purpose is to define the mechanism by which the various components of an ops publication are tied together and provides additional structure and semantics to the electronic publication this is accomplished by two xml files with the extensions opf and ncx opf file the opf file traditionally named content opf houses the epub book s metadata file manifest and linear reading order this file has a root element package and four child elements metadata manifest spine and guide furthermore the package node must have the unique identifier attribute the opf file s mime type is application oebps package xml the metadata element contains all the metadata information for a particular epub file three metadata tags are required though many more are available title language and identifier title contains the title of the book language contains the language of the book s contents in rfc format or its successors such as the newer rfc and identifier contains a unique identifier for the book such as its isbn or a url the identifier s id attribute should equal the unique identifier attribute from the package element the manifest element lists all the files contained in the package each file is represented by an item element and has the attributes id href media type all xhtml content documents stylesheets images or other media embedded fonts and the ncx file should be listed here only the opf file itself the container xml and the mimetype files should not be included the spine element lists all the xhtml content documents in their linear reading order also any content document that can be reached through linking or the table of contents must be listed as well the toc attribute of spine must contain the id of the ncx file listed in the manifest each itemref element s idref is set to the id of its respective content document the guide element is an optional element for the purpose of identifying fundamental structural components of the book each reference element has the attributes type title href files referenced in href must be listed in the manifest and are allowed to have an element identifier e g figures in the example an example opf file ncx file the ncx file navigation control file for xml traditionally named toc ncx contains the hierarchical table of contents for the epub file the specification for ncx was developed for digital talking book dtb is maintained by the daisy consortium and is not a part of the epub specification the ncx file has a mime type of application x dtbncx xml of note here is that the values for the doctitle docauthor and meta name dtb uid elements should match their analogs in the opf file also the meta name dtb depth element is set equal to the depth of the navmap element navpoint elements can be nested to create a hierarchical table of contents navlabel s content is the text that appears in the table of contents generated by reading systems that use the ncx navpoint s content element points to a content document listed in the manifest and can also include an element identifier e g section a description of certain exceptions to the ncx specification as used in epub is in section of the specification the complete specification for ncx can be found in the specifications for the digital talking book an example ncx file open container format an epub file is a group of files that conform to the ops opf standards and are wrapped in a ip file the ocf specifies how to organi e these files in the ip and defines two additional files that must be included the mimetype file must be a text document in ascii that contains the string application epub ip it must also be uncompressed unencrypted and the first file in the ip archive this file provides a more reliable way for applications to identify the mime type of the file than just the epub extension also there must be a folder named meta inf which contains the required file container xml this xml file points to the file defining the contents of the book this is the opf file though additional alternative rootfile elements are allowed apart from mimetype and meta inf container xml the other files opf ncx xhtml css and images files are traditionally put in a directory named oebps an example file structure ip container mime type meta inf container xml oebps content opf chapter xhtml ch pic png css style css myfont otf an example container xml given the above file structure version the epub recommended specification was approved on october on june epub was approved as a minor maintenance update to epub epub supersedes the previous release epub consists of a set of four specifications epub publications which defines publication level semantics and overarching conformance requirements for epub publications epub content documents which defines profiles of xhtml svg and css for use in the context of epub publications epub open container format ocf which defines a file format and processing model for encapsulating a set of related resources into a single file ip epub container epub media overlays which defines a format and a processing model for synchroni ation of text and audio the epub format was intended to address the following criticisms while good for text centric books epub was rather unsuitable for publications that require precise layout or speciali ed formatting such as comic books a major issue hindering the use of epub for most technical publications was the lack of support for equations formatted as mathml they were included as bitmap or svg images precluding proper handling by screen readers and interaction with computer algebra systems support for mathml is included in the epub specification other criticisms of epub were the specification s lack of detail on linking within or between epub books and its lack of a specification for annotation such linking is hindered by the use of a ip file as the container for epub furthermore it was unclear if it would be better to link by using epub s internal structural markup the opf specification mentioned above or directly to files through the ip s file structure the lack of a standardi ed way to annotate epub books led to difficulty in sharing and transferring annotations and therefore limited the use scenarios of epub particularly in educational settings because it cannot provide a level of interactivity comparable to the web on june the idpf published epub as a final recommended specification in november epub was published by the iso iec as iso iec ts parts in january epub was published by the iso iec as iso iec parts version epub was announced in and the final specification was released in a notable change is the removal of a speciali ed subset of css enabling the use of non epub prefixed properties the references to html and svg standards are also updated to newest version available as opposed to a fixed version in time version the w c announced version on may changes included stricter security and privacy standards and the adoption of the webp and opus media formats features the format and many readers support the following reflowable document optimi e text for a particular display fixed layout content pre paginated content can be useful for certain kinds of highly designed content such as illustrated books intended only for larger screens such as tablets like an html web site the format supports inline raster and vector images metadata and css styling page bookmarking passage highlighting and notes a library that stores books and can be searched re si able fonts and changeable text and background colors support for a subset of mathml better analytical support with compatible platforms digital rights management can contain digital rights management drm as an optional layer digital rights management an epub file can optionally contain drm as an additional layer but it is not required by the specifications in addition the specification does not name any particular drm system to use so publishers can choose a drm scheme to their liking however future versions of epub specifically ocf may specify a format for drm the epub specification does not enforce or suggest a particular drm scheme this could affect the level of support for various drm systems on devices and the portability of purchased e books consequently such drm incompatibility may segment the epub format along the lines of drm systems undermining the advantages of a single standard format and confusing the consumer drmed epub files must contain a file called rights xml within the meta inf directory at the root level of the ip container adoption epub is a popular format for electronic data interchange as it is based on html and other published standards and requires no licensing to implement epub is widely supported by software readers such as google play books on android and apple books on ios and macos and hardware such as ama on s kindle e readers the epub format is the underlying framework for apple s proprietary ibook format which depends upon code from the apple books app to function in ama on s send to kindle service removed support for its own kindle file format in favor of epub popular epub producers of public domain and open licensed content include project gutenberg standard ebooks pubmed central scielo and others security and privacy concerns epub requires readers to support the html javascript css svg formats making epub readers use the same technology as web browsers such formats are associated with various types of security issues and privacy breaching behaviors e g web beacons csrf xshm due to their complexity and flexibility such vulnerabilities can be used to implement web tracking and cross device tracking on epub files security researchers also identified attacks leading to local files and other user data being uploaded the epub overview document provides a security warning authors need to be aware that scripting in an epub publication can create security considerations that are different from scripting within a web browser for example typical same origin policies are not applicable to content that has been downloaded to a user s local system therefore it is strongly encouraged that scripting be limited to container constrained contexts implementation an epub file is an archive that contains in effect a website it includes html files images css style sheets and other assets it also contains metadata epub is the latest version by using html publications can contain video audio and interactivity just like websites in web browsers container an epub publication is delivered as a single file this file is an unencrypted ipped archive containing a set of interrelated resources an ocf open container format abstract container defines a file system model for the contents of the container the file system model uses a single common root directory for all contents in the container all non remote resources for publications are in the directory tree headed by the container s root directory though epub mandates no specific file system structure for this the file system model includes a mandatory directory named meta inf that is a direct child of the container s root directory meta inf stores container xml the first file in the archive must be the mime type file it must be unencrypted and uncompressed so that non ip utilities can read the mime type the mime type file must be an ascii file that contains the string application epub ip this file provides a more reliable way for applications to identify the mime type of the file than just the epub extension an example file structure ip container mime type meta inf container xml oebps content opf chapter xhtml ch pic png css

xml publication the epub container must contain at least one content document one navigation document one package document listing all publication resources this file should use the file extension opf

pronunciation lexicon specification pls documents media overlay documents contents content documents include html content navigation documents svg documents scripted content documents and fixed layout documents contents also include css and pls documents navigation documents supersede the ncx grammar used in epub media overlays books with synchroni ed audio narration are created in epub by using media overlay documents to describe the timing for the pre recorded audio narration and how it relates to the epub content document markup the file format for media overlays is defined as a subset of smil software epub reader software exists for all major computing platforms such as adobe digital editions and calibre on desktop platforms google play books and aldiko on android and ios and apple books on macos and ios there is also cross platform editor software for creating epub files including the open source programs calibre and sigil most modern web browsers also support epub reader plugins the microsoft edge browser had epub reader capability built in until september reading software the following software can read and display epub files creation software the following software
