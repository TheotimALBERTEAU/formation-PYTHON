comes from the latin francia or realm of the franks the name of the franks is related to the english word frank free the latter stems from the old french franc free noble sincere and ultimately from the medieval latin word francus free exempt from service a freeman a frank a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a late latin borrowing of the reconstructed frankish endonym frank it has been suggested that the meaning free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves the etymology of frank is uncertain it is traditionally derived from the proto germanic word frank n which translates as javelin or lance the throwing axe of the franks was known as the francisca although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the franks not the other way around in english france is pronounced franss in american english and frahnss or franss in british english the pronunciation with is mostly confined to accents with the trap bath split such as received pronunciation though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as cardiff english

antiquity th century bc th century ad in bc ionian greeks from phocaea founded the colony of massalia present day marseille celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern france spreading through the rest of the country between the th and rd century bc around bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to roman italy defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome this left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until bc when they entered into a peace treaty but the romans and the gauls remained adversaries for centuries around bc the south of gaul was conquered by the romans who called this region provincia nostra our province which evolved into provence in french julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt by gallic chieftain vercingetorix in bc gaul was divided by augustus into provinces and many cities were founded during the gallo roman period including lugdunum present day lyon the capital of the gauls in ad roman gaul suffered a crisis with its fortified borders attacked by barbarians the situation improved in the first half of the th century a period of revival and prosperity in emperor constantine i converted to christianity christians who had been persecuted increased but from the th century the barbarian invasions resumed teutonic tribes invaded the region the visigoths settling in the southwest the burgundians along the rhine valley and the franks in the north early middle ages th th century in late antiquity gaul was divided into germanic kingdoms and a remaining gallo roman territory celtic britons fleeing the anglo saxon settlement of britain settled in west armorica the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany and celtic culture was revived the first leader to unite all franks was clovis i who began his reign as king of the salian franks in routing the last forces of the roman governors in clovis said he would be baptised a christian in the event of victory against the visigothic kingdom which was said to have guaranteed the battle clovis regained the southwest from the visigoths and was baptised in clovis was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the western roman empire to convert to catholic christianity thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church by the papacy and french kings were called the most christian kings of france the franks embraced the christian gallo roman culture and gaul was renamed francia land of the franks the germanic franks adopted romanic languages clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death the franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs so four kingdoms emerged from that of clovis paris orl ans soissons and rheims the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace head of household one mayor of the palace charles martel defeated an umayyad invasion at the battle of tours in his son pepin the short sei ed the crown of francia from the weakened merovingians and founded the carolingian dynasty pepin s son charlemagne reunited the frankish

east francia middle francia and west francia west francia approximated the area occupied by modern france and was its precursor during the th and th centuries threatened by viking invasions france became a decentralised state the nobility s titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen thus was established feudalism in france some king s vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king after the battle of hastings in william the conqueror added king of england to his titles becoming vassal and the equal of the king of france creating recurring tensions high and late middle ages th th century the carolingian dynasty ruled france until when hugh capet was crowned king of the franks his descendants unified the country through wars and inheritance from the capetian rulers began to be referred as kings of france rather than kings of the franks later kings expanded their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern france by the th century royal authority became more assertive centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility clergy and commoners the nobility played a prominent role in crusades to restore christian access to the holy land french knights made up most reinforcements in the years of the crusades in such a fashion that the arabs referred to crusaders as franj french crusaders imported french into the levant making old french the base of the lingua franca frankish language of the crusader states the albigensian crusade was launched in to eliminate the heretical cathars in the southwest of modern day france from the th century the house of plantagenet rulers of the county of anjou established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of maine and touraine then built an empire from england to the pyrenees covering half of modern france tensions between france and the plantagenet empire would last a hundred years until philip ii of france conquered between and most continental possessions of the empire leaving england and aquitaine to the plantagenets charles iv the fair died without an heir in the crown passed to philip of valois rather than edward of plantagenet who became edward iii of england during the reign of philip the monarchy reached the height of its medieval power however philip s seat on the throne was contested by edward in and england and france entered the off and on hundred years war boundaries changed but landholdings inside france by english kings remained extensive for decades with charismatic leaders such as joan of arc french counterattacks won back most english continental territories france was struck by the black death from which half of the million population died early modern period th century the french renaissance saw cultural development and standardisation of french which became the official language of france and europe s aristocracy france became rivals of the house of habsburg during the italian wars which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid th century french explorers claimed lands in the americas paving expansion of the french colonial empire the rise of protestantism led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion this forced huguenots to flee to protestant regions such as the british isles and swit erland the wars were ended by henry iv s edict of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots spanish troops assisted the catholics from to and invaded france in spain and france returned to all out war between and the franco spanish war cost france casualties under louis xiii cardinal richelieu promoted centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power he destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private armies by the end of the s richelieu established the royal monopoly of force france fought in the thirty

as the fronde occurred this rebellion was driven by feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the royal absolute power the monarchy reached its peak during the th century and reign of louis xiv during which france further increased its influence by turning lords into courtiers at the palace of versailles his command of the military went unchallenged the sun king made france the leading european power france became the most populous european country and had tremendous influence over european politics economy and culture french became the most used language in diplomacy science and literature until the th century france took control of territories in the americas africa and asia in louis xiv revoked the edict of nantes forcing thousands of huguenots into exile and published the code noir providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling jews from french colonies under the wars of louis xv france lost new france and most indian possessions after its defeat in the seven years war its european territory kept growing however with acquisitions such as lorraine and corsica louis xv s weak rule including the decadence of his court discredited the monarchy which in part paved the way for the french revolution louis xvi supported america with money fleets and armies helping them win independence from great britain france gained revenge but verged on bankruptcy a factor that contributed to the revolution some of the enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circles and scientific breakthroughs such as the naming of oxygen and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers were achieved by french scientists french explorers took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions enlightenment philosophy in which reason is

french painter is said to have been the first to travel to italy and experience the early renaissance firsthand the renaissance painting school of fontainebleau was directly inspired by italian painters such as primaticcio and rosso fiorentino who both worked in france two of the most famous french artists of the time of the baroque era nicolas poussin and claude lorrain lived in italy french artists developed the rococo style in the th century as a more intimate imitation of the baroque style the works of the court endorsed artists antoine watteau fran ois boucher and jean honor fragonard being the most representative in the country the french revolution brought great changes as napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as jacques louis david and the highly influential acad mie des beaux arts defined the style known as academism in the second part of the th century france s influence over painting grew with the development of new styles of painting such as impressionism and symbolism the most famous impressionist painters of the period were camille pissarro douard manet edgar degas claude monet and auguste renoir the second generation of impressionist style painters paul c anne paul gauguin toulouse lautrec and georges seurat were also at the avant garde of artistic evolutions as well as the fauvist artists henri matisse andr derain and maurice de vlaminck at the beginning of the th century cubism was developed by georges braque and the spanish painter pablo picasso who was living in paris other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near paris such as vincent van gogh and wassily kandinsky in the early th century and in particular during the interwar period a loose collection of foreign artists of whom many were jewish formed the school of paris amongst these artists were marc chagall amedeo modigliani yit hak frenel jules pascin and others the second world war led to the deaths or exile of multiple artists

nobles to mark their powers some french castles that survive are chinon ch teau d angers ch teau de vincennes and the cathar castles during this era france had been using romanesque architecture like most of western europe gothic architecture originally named opus francigenum meaning french work was born in le de france and was the first french style of architecture to be imitated throughout europe northern france is the home of some of the most important gothic cathedrals and basilicas the first of these being the saint denis basilica used as the royal necropolis other important french gothic cathedrals are notre dame de chartres and notre dame d amiens the kings were crowned in another important gothic church notre dame de reims the final victory in the hundred years war marked an important stage in the evolution of french architecture it was the time of the french renaissance and several artists from italy were invited to the french court many residential palaces were built in the loire valley from as a first reference the ch teau de montsoreau examples of such residential castles include the ch teau de chambord the ch teau de chenonceau or the ch teau d amboise following the renaissance and the end of the middle ages baroque architecture replaced the traditional gothic style baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one in the secular domain the palace of versailles has many baroque features jules hardouin mansart who designed the extensions to versailles was one of the most influential french architects of the baroque era he is famous for his dome at les invalides some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet french such as place stanislas in nancy on the military architectural side vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in europe and became an influential military architect as a result imitations of his works can be found all over europe the americas russia and turkey after the revolution the republicans favoured neoclassicism although it was introduced in france before the revolution with such buildings as the parisian pantheon or the capitole de toulouse built during the french first empire the arc de triomphe and sainte marie madeleine represent the best example of empire style architecture under napoleon iii a wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth extravagant buildings such as the neo baroque palais garnier were built the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous most notably haussmann s renovation of paris the architecture associated with this era is named second empire in english the term being taken from the second french empire at this time there was a strong gothic resurgence across europe and in france the associated architect was eug ne viollet le duc in the late th century gustave eiffel designed many bridges such as the garabit viaduct and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time although he is best remembered for the eiffel tower in the th century french swiss architect le corbusier designed several buildings in france more recently

within french cities are skyscrapers as they are visible from afar for instance in paris since new buildings had to be under metres ft a significant number of skyscrapers are located in the la d fense financial district other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges an example of the way this has been done is the millau viaduct some famous modern
